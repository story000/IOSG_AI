    You are a professional market research analyst working in a Venture Capital firm. Your role is to generate structured, data-driven insights based on internal discussions and external knowledge.  Assume you're drafting an internal investment memo for the IC team at a top-tier VC firm. The output will be read by GPs and used for decision-making. Follow these principles:
    - Deliver evidence-backed analysis using specific metrics (e.g. revenue, user growth, CAC, retention)
    - Highlight unique market signals and non-obvious insights
    - Use precise and domain-specific technical terminology
    - Frame competitive comparisons around clear differentiators (e.g. GTM strategy, business model, tech stack)
    - Analyze market trends, business model evolution, and future risks/opportunities
    - Structure your response clearly with logical flow. Avoid bullet spam or unordered data dumps.
    - Write in Bessemer-style memo format, which is concise, structured.

    # Market Overview

    Credit isn’t just another hype narrative that comes and goes. It’s a fundamental pillar of how our world operates, and crypto is no exception. It drives market liquidity, supports innovation, and helps the entire ecosystem succeed. Without credit, growth and innovation are held back, limiting how much the market can develop.If we look at traditional markets, the unsecured business loans market size was valued at $4.3 trillion in 2021 according to a [report](

    https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/unsecured-business-loans-market-A15157

    ) from Allied Market Research, and is projected to reach $12.5 trillion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 11.7%.Meanwhile, the crypto lending space peaked at less than 1.5% of the traditional market’s volume in 2022. Although 2021 and 2022 highlighted the sector’s potential, it has since taken a significant hit, contracting by 90% year-over-year in uncollateralized lending. Let’s be honest: the outlook is bleak, and there’s no immediate sign of recovery. Instead, many in the industry are now repackaging another settlement layer under a new label — whether it’s “we only lend to market makers” or “we only lend to fintech companies in Latin America.” However, these approaches often overlook critical questions: Who will be the lender? What can you offer them to invest in your opportunities? How will you restore trust?We should start by analyzing the known market sizes of major players in the crypto lending space in 2022. This includes firms like Celsius, BlockFi, Genesis, and various DeFi lending platforms, which collectively represented approximately **$30 billion** in outstanding loans at their peak.However, this figure captures only a portion of the total market. To derive a more comprehensive estimate, we considered additional significant segments, including:- **Earning programs at exchanges**: Major exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken have their own lending desks, which contribute substantially to the total market volume.

    - **Lending books of other major players**: Companies like Nexo, Tether, and Galaxy Digital have substantial lending activities that are not always fully disclosed publicly.
    - **Undisclosed institutional lending**: Many transactions and loan agreements occur in less transparent settings, such as OTC, contributing further to the market size.Given the partial visibility of these operations and the dynamic nature of the crypto market, we conservatively estimated that these additional segments at least double the visible market size, leading to an adjusted figure of approximately **$60 billion**. If we compare this to the traditional finance unsecured business loans market, which is about $4.3 trillion, crypto lending accounts for a bit less than 1.5%.

    5. Signed APIs are best: Public key cryptography is verifiable, Web3 wallets can sign activity

    Maple Finance offers collateralized pools with mainly fixed-term maturities for accredited investors

    Clearpool focuses on uncollateralized lending with open tenor lines and dynamic rates driven by utilization, operating predominantly in a permissionless manner.

    Goldfinch utilizes fixed-term maturity pools with set interest rates, and entities like FalconX or Hidden Road, acting as centralized prime brokers, provide their clients with leverage secured by the borrowers' margins and enforced by sophisticated risk engines. 

    Additionally, each of these platforms often caters to specific borrower profiles, such as market-neutral HFT firms, SMEs, or fintech companies.

    Accountable offers some unique features

    1. **Comprehensive Data Integration**: Unlike platforms that rely heavily on conventional financial metrics and collateral-based models, Accountable V2 emphasizes live, data-driven verification of assets across multiple channels. This integration allows for a deeper understanding of a borrower's financial health beyond what static snapshots or periodic updates can provide.
    2. **Flexibility in Credit Terms**: Our marketplace will support a versatile range of credit terms, accommodating both fixed and open tenors, with interest rates that can be either fixed or dynamically adjusted based on real-time market conditions and borrower creditworthiness. This flexibility stands in contrast to the rigid lending structures typically found in traditional finance and some crypto marketplaces.
    3. **Neutral and Inclusive Platform**: While platforms like FalconX and August might cater to specific types of clients or financial instruments, Accountable V2 aims to be truly neutral, catering to a diverse range of borrowers and lenders. This includes SMEs, fintech startups, and institutional players, providing a more inclusive market environment.
    4. **Permissioned and Permissionless Engagement**: Accountable V2 will offer full flexibility to choose between permissioned and permissionless environments where all parties can interact with transparency and without the need for intermediaries. This contrasts with the often gated and intermediary-reliant nature of traditional prime brokerage services and other centralized platforms.
    5. **Enhanced Risk Management Tools**: Utilizing advanced analytics, Accountable V2 will offer sophisticated risk assessment tools that go beyond traditional credit scoring. This allows for more nuanced risk management that can adapt to the rapidly changing conditions in the crypto markets.
    6. **Integration of Non-Traditional Assets**: Beyond just crypto assets, Accountable plans to include a wider array of non-traditional assets such as tokenized real estate, NFTs, LP positions and other relevant collateral options, broadening the scope of assets that can be used for securing loans.

    Industry / Market Research
    NFT marketplaces are the most significant infrastructure of the whole NFT area, and Opensea has been the top1 player for a long time. But by the end of 2022, Blur changed the market pattern.


    Now Blur occupies 70% of the whole NFT market.




    For the past month, Blur’s volume outweighs any other platforms, but the gas cost is 60% of Opensea, due to the gas saving mechanism. Also, the sales and wallets are less than Opensea, maybe because some of the users of Blur use bidding or Blend instead of trading.

    https://www.nftscan.com/marketplace

    Blur’s daily traders are half of Opensea, we can know that the trading volume of traders on Blur is much higher than those on Opensea.

    For the NFTFi area, Blur also occupies the largest market share, for almost 60%.

    https://www.nftscan.com/nftfi?module=analytics
    From an overall perspective of the whole NFT market, Blur is a game changing player and significant infrastructure. It changed the monopoly of Opensea and the rules of NFT.
