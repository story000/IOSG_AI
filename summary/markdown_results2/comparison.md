# Market Overview

The high-performance DeFi infrastructure and trading blockchain market is defined by the convergence of institutional-grade trading requirements, the need for capital efficiency, and the demand for composable, low-latency onchain applications. The total addressable market (TAM) is anchored by global crypto derivatives trading, which reached ~$2.5T in monthly volume in 2024 (source: Coingecko, The Block), with perpetuals and options accounting for >80% of onchain trading activity. DeFi’s share of this market remains <5% of total crypto derivatives, but is growing at a 40–60% YoY rate, driven by the migration of sophisticated trading strategies and market makers from centralized venues.

Key market drivers include:
- **Technical constraints**: Existing L1s (Ethereum, Solana) are bottlenecked by compute and latency, limiting the feasibility of high-frequency trading, advanced margining, and real-time risk engines.
- **Regulatory pressure**: Ongoing regulatory scrutiny of centralized exchanges (CEXs) is accelerating institutional exploration of onchain venues, provided they can meet performance and compliance requirements.
- **User behavior**: There is a clear bifurcation between “pro” traders (seeking deep liquidity, advanced order types, and low latency) and retail users (seeking ease of use, gamified interfaces, and new asset classes).

Pain points remain acute: capital inefficiency (e.g., overcollateralization, primitive AMMs), fragmented liquidity, and poor user experience (onboarding friction, wallet fragmentation, slow bridging). The next inflection point is likely to be the emergence of L1/L2s that can deliver CEX-like performance and composability, catalyzing a shift of both liquidity and developer mindshare.

Strategic risks include: regulatory clampdowns on DeFi, the risk of “winner-take-most” network effects around liquidity, and the potential for commoditization of execution infrastructure as more performant L1s/L2s launch.

# Target Customer & Use Case

**Primary customer segments:**
- **Professional trading firms and market makers** (HFTs, quant desks, prop shops): Require deterministic execution, sub-100ms latency, and advanced risk/margin systems. Geographically concentrated in US, EU, and Asia.
- **DeFi protocol developers**: Building orderbooks, AMMs, structured products, and new asset classes (e.g., narrative trading, synthetic assets).
- **Retail power users**: Engaged in perpetuals/options, seeking new trading primitives, gamified experiences, and composability.

**Unmet needs:**
- Deterministic, low-latency execution (sub-100ms) for onchain orderbooks and market making
- Capital efficiency: cross-margining, multi-asset collateral, advanced risk engines
- Composability: seamless cross-app liquidity and messaging without bridging delays
- Frictionless onboarding: wallet abstraction, instant bridging, multi-chain signature support

**Why now:** 
- Institutional and pro-retail demand for onchain venues is at an all-time high, but existing infra cannot meet performance or UX requirements. The market is at a tipping point as new L1s/L2s (Hyperliquid, Monad, N1) demonstrate the feasibility of CEX-like onchain trading, and as regulatory headwinds push more activity onchain.

# Competitive Landscape

| Feature / Player         | Hyperliquid           | Drift (Solana)         | Monad                  | N1 ({{input._name}})         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Execution Model**     | App-specific L1, custom orderbook engine | Solana L1, hybrid AMM/orderbook | EVM-equivalent L1, parallelized execution | Decoupled settlement/execution, per-app VMs |
| **Latency**             | ~100ms (measured)     | ~400–600ms (Solana)    | Target <100ms, not live | Sub-ms (target), co-location supported |
| **Compute Model**       | Centralized sequencer, custom infra | Solana runtime, limited by L1 | Parallel EVM, speculative execution | Per-app containers, VM-agnostic (Rust, TS, C, etc.) |
| **Capital Efficiency**  | Advanced margin, cross-collateral | Basic cross-margin, limited assets | EVM-compatible, not yet proven | Multi-asset margin, custom risk engines |
| **Composability**       | Limited, single app focus | Solana-native, moderate | EVM-native, cross-app via EVM | Native cross-app messaging, instant finality |
| **Distribution**        | Direct to pro traders, closed ecosystem | Solana DeFi users, open | EVM devs, infra focus | Pro traders, market makers, app incubations |
| **Business Model**      | Exchange fees, no token | Protocol fees, token incentives | Protocol fees, token | Network fees, revenue share from apps, token |
| **Go-to-Market**        | Flagship perp DEX, liquidity bootstrapping | Community-driven, open dev | Infra-first, dev onboarding | Incubated apps (01 Exchange), MM partnerships |
| **Ecosystem**           | Closed, single app focus | Open, Solana DeFi | Open, EVM | Semi-permissioned launch, expanding to open |

**N1’s angle of attack:**  
N1 is targeting the intersection of high-performance trading and composable DeFi by offering a VM-agnostic, per-app execution environment with decoupled settlement. The initial focus is on incubating flagship trading apps (e.g., 01 Exchange) with direct market maker partnerships (Amber, CMS), and capturing both protocol and application-level revenue via equity and fee-sharing. N1’s technical differentiator is the ability to horizontally scale compute per app, support sub-ms latency (including co-location), and enable instant cross-app composability without bridging or consensus bottlenecks.

# Analyst Commentary

**Gap addressed:**  
N1 is targeting the structural limitations of both existing L1s (compute, latency, composability) and app-specific chains (lack of ecosystem, single point of failure). The architecture is designed to enable CEX-grade trading primitives (advanced margin, real-time risk, novel asset classes) while preserving onchain composability and developer flexibility (multi-language, per-app VMs).

**Tailwinds:**  
- Institutional migration to onchain venues as CEX risk and regulatory pressure increase
- Growing sophistication of DeFi users and demand for capital efficiency
- Technical validation from early high-performance L1s (Hyperliquid, Monad) and the success of app-specific chains in capturing liquidity

**Headwinds:**  
- Network effects around liquidity are difficult to overcome; “winner-take-most” dynamics favor early movers
- Regulatory uncertainty, especially for perpetuals and synthetic assets
- Execution risk: delivering on sub-ms latency and composability at scale is non-trivial

**Early signals:**  
- N1 has secured strategic partnerships with leading market makers (Amber, CMS), and is co-incubating flagship trading apps with proven teams (e.g., 01 Exchange, ex-dYdX/CT traders).
- Liquidity bootstrapping program ($20M committed) and early mainnet benchmarks (50k+ TPS on Ethereum) indicate technical feasibility and market interest.
- Revenue projections ($10–30M in year one, with upside from app revenue share) are credible if flagship apps achieve even a fraction of Hyperliquid’s current volume ($700M annualized revenue, ~3–4k active traders).

In summary, the market is at an inflection point: the first L1/L2 to deliver CEX-grade performance, capital efficiency, and composability will be well-positioned to capture both institutional and developer mindshare. N1’s approach—combining technical innovation with a focused go-to-market via app incubation and liquidity partnerships—addresses the core pain points of the current DeFi trading stack, but faces significant execution and adoption risks in a rapidly evolving landscape.

# Market Overview

The high-performance DeFi infrastructure and trading blockchain market is defined by the convergence of institutional-grade trading requirements (low latency, high throughput, advanced risk management) with the composability and transparency of onchain systems. The total addressable market (TAM) is anchored by global crypto derivatives trading, which reached ~$60T in annualized volume in 2023 (source: TokenInsight, The Block), with perpetuals accounting for >80% of activity. Onchain derivatives remain <2% of this flow, but are growing at a 60–80% YoY rate, driven by user migration from centralized venues post-FTX and the maturation of DeFi primitives.

Key market drivers include:
- **Technical constraints**: Existing L1s (Ethereum, Solana) bottleneck high-frequency trading due to compute limits and latency (typically 400–800ms), constraining capital efficiency and product design (e.g., primitive AMMs, basic margining).
- **Regulatory pressure**: Ongoing regulatory scrutiny of centralized exchanges (CEXs) is accelerating institutional and retail migration to onchain venues, provided performance and compliance needs are met.
- **User behavior**: Power users (CT traders, market makers) demand CEX-like UX, composable margin, and deep liquidity, while retail seeks frictionless onboarding and novel asset classes (e.g., narrative trading, gamified options).

Pain points remain acute: fragmented liquidity, poor capital efficiency, and limited developer tooling for high-performance apps. The next inflection point is likely to be the first onchain venue that can consistently deliver CEX-level performance and liquidity, catalyzing a liquidity flywheel and ecosystem lock-in. Strategic risks include regulatory clampdowns on derivatives, the potential for “winner-take-most” network effects, and the challenge of bootstrapping real (not farmed) liquidity.

# Target Customer & Use Case

**Primary segments:**
- **Professional traders and market makers** (CTs, HFTs, quant firms): Require sub-100ms execution, advanced margining, and direct API/co-location access. Concentrated in North America, Asia, and Europe.
- **DeFi-native builders**: Teams building structured products, vaults, and trading protocols that need composability and high compute.
- **Retail speculators**: Users seeking novel trading primitives (e.g., meme/narrative markets, gamified options) with seamless onboarding.

**Unmet needs:**
- CEX-grade latency and throughput for onchain orderbooks and margin systems
- Capital efficiency (cross-margin, multi-asset collateral, advanced risk engines)
- Frictionless onboarding (wallet abstraction, instant bridging)
- Composability for new asset classes and trading strategies

**Market timing:** The collapse of FTX and regulatory headwinds for CEXs have created urgency for credible onchain alternatives. The technical maturation of L1s and L2s, combined with institutional interest in DeFi rails, makes this a critical window for infrastructure that can deliver both performance and composability.

# Analyst Commentary

**Gap addressed:** N1 targets the intersection of CEX-grade performance and DeFi composability, aiming to unlock high-compute, low-latency trading and financial primitives that are infeasible on current L1s/L2s. The architecture (decoupled settlement/execution, per-app containers, VM-agnostic) is designed to eliminate noisy neighbor and state contention issues, enabling both institutional-grade trading and rapid experimentation with new asset classes.

**Tailwinds:**
- Institutional demand for onchain derivatives and structured products is rising, but current infra cannot meet latency/capital efficiency requirements.
- Regulatory pressure on CEXs is accelerating the search for compliant, transparent alternatives.
- Early signals from Hyperliquid (>$700M annualized revenue, 3–4k active users, high volume/user) validate the “CEX-onchain” thesis, but also highlight the importance of real user and liquidity acquisition over pure technical merit.

**Headwinds:**
- Liquidity network effects are sticky; bootstrapping real (not farmed) liquidity is non-trivial.
- Execution centralization (e.g., container operators) may raise censorship and reliability concerns.
- Ecosystem lock-in risk: single-app chains (Hyperliquid) may struggle to generalize, while open ecosystems (Solana, Monad) face fragmentation and noisy neighbor problems.

**Early signals:** N1 has secured strategic partnerships with major market makers (Amber, CMS), a $20M liquidity program, and is co-incubating its flagship perp DEX with a team responsible for ~10% of Hyperliquid’s volume. The initial go-to-market is tightly focused on catalyzing real volume and liquidity, with a roadmap to open up permissionless deployment as network effects take hold.

**Summary:** The market is at an inflection point: the first L1 to deliver CEX-grade performance, capital efficiency, and composability will likely catalyze a liquidity flywheel and ecosystem lock-in. N1’s architecture and GTM strategy are well-aligned with these requirements, but success will depend on execution, liquidity acquisition, and the ability to sustain a credible ecosystem beyond the flagship DEX.

**Response Time**: 63.64s

**Response**:

**To:** Investment Committee
**From:** [Your Name], Market Research
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Subject:** Market & Competitive Overview: N1 (High-Performance DeFi Infrastructure)

### **1. Market Overview**

The on-chain derivatives market represents a significant and rapidly growing segment of DeFi. While centralized exchanges (CEXs) still dominate total crypto derivatives volume (>$50T in 2023), on-chain venues are capturing an increasing share, driven by user demand for self-custody, permissionless access, and innovative products. The on-chain perpetuals market alone saw volumes exceed $400B in Q1 2024, a 4x YoY increase.

This growth is fueled by a clear market need for specialized, high-performance blockchain infrastructure. General-purpose L1s and L2s, while functional, impose critical limitations on trading applications.

**Key Market Drivers & Pain Points:**

*   **Technical Drivers (The Appchain Thesis):** The market is shifting from monolithic, general-purpose chains to specialized, application-specific execution environments. Projects have validated that dedicating blockspace to a single application (e.g., dYdX, Hyperliquid) results in superior performance and user experience. The primary pain point remains achieving CEX-level performance (sub-millisecond latency, high throughput) without compromising settlement security.
*   **User Behavior Drivers (Post-FTX Flight to Safety):** The collapse of FTX accelerated the migration of sophisticated traders and volume to on-chain venues. These users demand low-latency execution and capital-efficient margining systems, features where current DEXs lag CEXs. They are highly sensitive to latency arbitrage and slippage, which are prevalent on chains with >500ms block times.
*   **Economic Drivers (Liquidity & Capital Efficiency):** Liquidity converges on the most capital-efficient venues. Current on-chain models like x*y=k AMMs or basic cross-margin systems are inefficient compared to TradFi or CEX risk engines. There is a substantial opportunity for platforms that can support more complex, computationally intensive models, thereby improving liquidity depth and pricing.

**Future Outlook & Strategic Risks:**

The market is in a consolidation phase around a few winning models: integrated appchains (Hyperliquid), high-performance general L1s (Solana), and parallelized EVMs (Monad). The key inflection point will be the emergence of a platform that can host multiple CEX-competitive applications within a single, composable, and liquid ecosystem. The primary strategic risk is the commoditization of transaction fees, forcing infrastructure providers to move up the stack to capture value, for instance, through application-layer revenue sharing.

### **2. Target Customer & Use Case**

N1 targets the most demanding and lucrative segments of the on-chain economy.

*   **Primary Customer Segments:**
    1.  **High-Frequency & Quantitative Trading Firms:** Entities that require sub-millisecond latency, co-location services, and the ability to deploy complex, proprietary trading algorithms directly on-chain. For them, every millisecond of latency is a direct P&L impact.
    2.  **Professional Traders & Market Makers:** High-volume individuals and firms (like the founding team of 01 Exchange) who are the primary liquidity and volume drivers on platforms like dYdX and Hyperliquid. They require deep liquidity, advanced order types, and robust, capital-efficient cross-margining systems.
    3.  **DeFi Protocol Developers:** Teams building sophisticated financial applications (e.g., structured products, complex lending protocols, novel AMMs) that are currently constrained by the low-compute, high-gas environments of existing chains.

*   **Unmet Needs & Motivations:** The core unmet need is for an on-chain environment that eliminates the performance and capital efficiency trade-offs versus CEXs. This includes:
    *   **Execution:** Sub-millisecond execution confirmation to prevent front-running and latency arbitrage.
    *   **Capital Efficiency:** CEX-grade cross-collateral and portfolio margin systems that allow for more efficient use of capital.
    *   **Composability:** The ability for high-performance applications to interact seamlessly without the latency and security overhead of cross-chain bridges.

*   **Market Timing:** The timing is opportune. Hyperliquid has validated the product-market fit for a vertically integrated, high-performance perp DEX. The market is now looking for the next evolution: a platform that can support an entire ecosystem of such applications, not just a single one.

### **3. Competitive Landscape**

N1 enters a competitive but clearly segmented market. Its primary competitors are not just other L1s, but specific models for achieving high performance.

*   **Hyperliquid:** The direct incumbent for the "integrated perp DEX appchain" model. Built on its own L1 using Tendermint, it operates a centralized sequencer for performance. Its key differentiator is its first-mover advantage, strong brand recognition among traders, and a simple, highly effective product that generates substantial revenue (~$700M annualized per N1 team).
*   **Drift Protocol:** A leading perp DEX on Solana. It differentiates by leveraging the underlying performance and composability of the Solana ecosystem. Its GTM is ecosystem-native, integrating with wallets, aggregators, and liquid staking protocols to drive growth. It offers a broader suite of products (spot, borrow/lend) beyond just perps.
*   **Monad:** A forthcoming high-performance L1 focused on parallelizing the EVM. Its angle is to offer a 100-1000x performance improvement for the existing EVM developer base and dApp ecosystem. Its key differentiator is full EVM bytecode compatibility, minimizing migration friction for a massive developer community. Its GTM is ecosystem-centric, aiming to become the default high-performance layer for all things EVM.

**N1's Angle of Attack:** N1 is not just building a faster chain; it's proposing a new architecture for a high-performance ecosystem. Its attack vector is to combine the performance of a centralized execution environment with the security of a decentralized settlement layer, while enabling horizontal scaling through isolated application "containers." This allows it to:
1.  Outperform single-purpose appchains like Hyperliquid by supporting a composable, multi-app ecosystem.
2.  Offer superior isolation and guaranteed performance compared to shared-state models like Solana or Monad.
3.  Differentiate its business model by capturing application-layer value through revenue-sharing agreements, insulating it from the commoditization of L1 fees.

| Feature | **N1** | **Hyperliquid** | **Drift Protocol (on Solana)** | **Monad** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture** | Decoupled Execution/Settlement; App-specific "containers" | Integrated L1 (Tendermint) with centralized sequencer | dApp on Solana shared-state L1 | Parallelized EVM L1 |
| **Performance** | <1ms latency; 100k+ TPS per container (horizontally scalable) | ~1s latency; ~20k TPS | Solana's performance (~500ms latency, ~5k TPS) | ~1s finality; 10k TPS target |
| **VM / Dev Env.** | VM-Agnostic (Rust, TypeScript initially, then Python, C++) | Custom | Solana VM (Rust) | Parallelized EVM (Solidity, Vyper) |
| **GTM Strategy** | Incubate flagship apps (01 Exchange) with rev-share; attract MMs | Vertically integrated: build and operate its own killer app | Ecosystem-native: leverage Solana's network effects | Attract existing EVM ecosystem with superior performance |
| **Business Model** | Hybrid: Network fees + App-layer revenue share | Trading fees from its own exchange | Trading fees from its dApp | L1 network fees |
| **Key Differentiator**| Horizontally scalable, multi-app ecosystem with guaranteed performance per app | First-mover in integrated perp appchains; strong brand | Deep integration with the broad Solana ecosystem | EVM-compatibility at scale |

### **4. Analyst Commentary**

N1's thesis is that the future of on-chain finance is not a single, faster general-purpose chain, but a network of specialized, high-performance applications that are deeply composable. It is attempting to fill the gap between single-app chains (Hyperliquid) and shared-state L1s (Solana, Monad).

*   **Tailwinds:**
    *   **Validated GTM:** The "build a killer app first" strategy is proven. N1's co-incubation of 01 Exchange with a high-profile trader and Amber Group is a strong signal of a well-executed, distribution-focused GTM.
    *   **Sustainable Business Model:** The revenue-sharing agreement with incubated apps is a significant differentiator. It aligns the L1 with application success and creates a durable revenue stream beyond transaction fees, which face long-term pricing pressure.
    *   **Strong Backing:** The quality of the team and investors (Founders Fund, Anatoly Yakovenko, Arthur Hayes) provides significant credibility, network access, and a higher probability of success.

*   **Headwinds & Risks:**
    *   **Technical Execution Risk:** The bespoke architecture (decoupled layers, set replication) is complex. Delivering on the sub-millisecond latency and security promises is a substantial technical challenge.
    *   **Ecosystem Cold Start Problem:** The model's success is contingent on the success of its initial incubated applications. If 01 Exchange fails to capture significant market share from incumbents like Hyperliquid, N1's core liquidity flywheel will not materialize.
    *   **Intense Competition:** Monad's EVM compatibility presents a powerful moat by tapping into the largest existing web3 developer community. N1 must prove its bespoke environment offers a 10x advantage to justify developers learning a new paradigm.

*   **Early Signals:** The team's direct experience with the limitations of Solana for building order books provides them with unique, earned insight into the problem. The decision to support existing wallet standards (Ethereum/Solana) and build a native, fast bridge from Solana demonstrates a pragmatic, user-centric approach to overcoming adoption friction. The oversubscribed strategic round confirms strong market conviction in the team and their approach.

**Response Time**: 62.22s

**Response**:

**To:** Investment Committee
**From:** [Your Name], Market Research
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Subject:** Investment Memo: Market & Competitive Overview for N1

This memo provides a market and competitive analysis for N1, a proposed high-performance L1 blockchain targeting the on-chain trading and DeFi sector. The analysis is based on our meeting with the founding team and a review of their technical and strategic documentation.

### 1. Market Overview

The on-chain derivatives market is the primary TAM for performance-focused blockchains. In Q1 2024, perpetual DEXs alone recorded over $550B in trading volume, a 360% increase QoQ. Despite this growth, on-chain derivatives still represent <2% of the total crypto derivatives market, which is dominated by CEXs processing trillions in monthly volume. This delta highlights a significant opportunity for on-chain venues that can close the performance and liquidity gap with their centralized counterparts.

**Market Drivers & Pain Points:**
*   **Technical Drivers:** The market is shifting from monolithic L1s toward specialized execution environments. The success of application-specific rollups and the development of parallelized EVMs (e.g., Monad) signal a demand for architectures that solve the "noisy neighbor" problem, where one high-traffic application degrades performance for all others.
*   **User Behavior Drivers:** A segment of sophisticated traders and institutions is increasingly seeking on-chain venues for self-custody and transparency, but current infrastructure fails to meet their performance requirements. The median latency of ~500ms on performant L1s like Solana is an order of magnitude too high for competitive market making, creating arbitrage opportunities that ultimately result in worse pricing for users.
*   **Pain Points:** The primary pain points are (1) high execution latency, (2) non-deterministic transaction inclusion during periods of high network load, and (3) broken composability between siloed L2s, which fragments liquidity.

**Future Outlook & Strategic Risks:**
The next cycle will likely see a consolidation of liquidity onto a few platforms that offer CEX-level performance with DEX-level transparency. The key inflection point will be the emergence of an L1/L2 that can successfully bootstrap a flagship derivatives venue and a surrounding ecosystem of composable DeFi primitives. The primary strategic risk is the centralization-performance trade-off. While users demand performance, the market and regulators may be resistant to architectures that rely on centralized sequencers or execution operators, which is a core component of N1's design.

### 2. Target Customer & Use Case

N1 is targeting the most demanding users in the DeFi ecosystem, whose needs are unmet by general-purpose blockchains.

**Primary Customer Segments:**
1.  **Quantitative Trading Firms & HFTs:** As both builders and users of DeFi protocols. They require sub-millisecond execution latency, high compute for complex risk modeling (e.g., multi-asset cross-margining), and the ability to co-locate servers to minimize network latency. The team building N1's flagship app, 01 Exchange, fits this profile.
2.  **Protocol Developers:** Teams building sophisticated DeFi applications (e.g., structured products, advanced AMMs, borrow/lend protocols) that are currently computationally infeasible on-chain. The ability to use mainstream languages like TypeScript is a significant draw for this segment.
3.  **High-Volume "Pro-sumer" Traders:** The power users of platforms like dYdX and Hyperliquid, who generate the majority of volume and revenue. They are highly sensitive to execution speed, slippage, and trading fees.

**Relevance & Unmet Needs:**
This market is relevant now because the limitations of the current L1/L2 paradigm are a clear bottleneck to growth. Hyperliquid's success ($700M in annualized revenue from ~4,000 active users, per the N1 team) has validated the massive product-market fit for a vertically integrated, high-performance trading experience. The primary unmet need is a platform that can provide this CEX-like performance without sacrificing on-chain settlement security and while enabling a composable ecosystem of applications that can share liquidity and state.

### 3. Competitive Landscape

N1 enters a competitive but clearly defined space. Its primary competitors are other performance-oriented L1s and vertically integrated trading platforms.

**Angle of Attack:**
N1's strategy is a hybrid of its competitors'. It adopts the **Go-to-Market playbook of Hyperliquid** (incubate a killer app, 01 Exchange, to drive initial adoption and liquidity) but combines it with the **platform ambition of Monad** (build a foundational layer for a broad ecosystem).

Its core technical differentiator is the **decoupled execution/settlement architecture**. Unlike Monad, which parallelizes the EVM, N1 isolates applications in discrete "containers," allowing for app-specific VMs and preventing resource contention. This is a more radical architectural departure that trades decentralization at the execution layer for performance. Furthermore, its proposed **revenue-sharing business model**, where the L1 captures a percentage of application-layer revenue, is a distinct approach to value accrual compared to relying solely on network fees or MEV.

**Competitive Comparison:**

| Feature | **N1** | **Hyperliquid** | **Drift Protocol (on Solana)** | **Monad** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture** | Decoupled L1: Centralized execution (containers), decentralized settlement. | Vertically integrated L1 + Perp DEX. Tendermint-based consensus. | Application on a monolithic L1 (Solana). | Parallelized, EVM-compatible L1. |
| **Performance** | Sub-ms execution latency. 100k+ TPS per container. | ~1s block time. High throughput for a single application. | ~500ms slot time. Subject to Solana network performance. | ~1s block time. Targets 10k+ TPS for EVM. |
| **VM / Dev Env** | VM-Agnostic (Rust, TypeScript initially; Python, C planned). | Custom L1, not open for general development. | Solana VM (Rust). | Superset of EVM (byte-for-byte compatible). |
| **GTM Strategy** | Incubate flagship app (01 Exchange) first, then open platform. | Build a single, dominant application (the Hyperliquid exchange). | Build a premier application on an existing, liquid L1. | Build a superior general-purpose L1 to attract the existing EVM ecosystem. |
| **Value Accrual** | Network fees + Revenue share from incubated apps. Explicitly anti-MEV. | Exchange fees. | Exchange fees. | Network fees + MEV (via partnerships like with Flashbots). |

### 4. Analyst Commentary

N1 is addressing a well-understood and high-value problem: the performance limitations of on-chain trading. The team's direct experience building an order book on Solana provides them with exceptional founder-market fit and a credible technical narrative.

**Gap in the Market:**
N1 is attempting to create a new category: a curated, high-performance ecosystem. While Hyperliquid is a siloed application and Monad is a general-purpose performance upgrade for the EVM, N1 aims to provide the best of both worlds: a purpose-built environment for a flagship trading venue that is also a composable platform for other high-performance dApps. The containerized architecture is a novel approach to solving the "noisy neighbor" problem at the L1 level.

**Tailwinds:**
*   **Proven Demand:** Hyperliquid's traction validates the demand for CEX-like performance on-chain.
*   **App-Chain Thesis:** The market is increasingly receptive to application-specific chains and rollups that prioritize performance for a specific use case.
*   **Strategic GTM:** The incubation model is capital-efficient and focuses resources on bootstrapping a core user base and liquidity pool before attempting broader ecosystem growth. The co-incubation of 01 Exchange with Amber and a high-volume trader is a strong early signal.

**Headwinds & Risks:**
*   **Execution Risk:** The GTM is entirely dependent on the success of 01 Exchange. A failure to launch or gain traction would severely undermine the entire network's value proposition.
*   **Centralization Trade-off:** The centralized execution model is a significant departure from crypto's core ethos. This could limit adoption among decentralization purists and attract regulatory scrutiny. The team's plan for progressive decentralization of container operation will be critical to monitor.
*   **Intense Competition:** The space is well-funded and crowded. Monad has significant momentum and mindshare in the EVM community, while Solana's performance and ecosystem continue to mature.

**Early Signals:**
The team's focus on a sustainable value accrual model (app-layer revenue sharing) over extractive models like MEV is a sophisticated and potentially durable differentiator. The backing from Founders Fund and a strong cohort of strategic angels (Anatoly Yakovenko, Arthur Hayes) provides significant credibility and network access. The proposed valuation of $80M is aggressive but reflects the high-value market segment and the strength of the team and early strategy.

# Market Overview

The high-performance DeFi infrastructure and trading blockchain market focuses on layer-1 networks optimized for low-latency, high-throughput applications like perpetual futures, order books, and automated market makers. Based on CoinMarketCap data, the total crypto derivatives trading volume reached $6.2 trillion in Q2 2025, representing a TAM of approximately $25 trillion annualized, with DeFi infrastructure capturing about 5% ($1.25 trillion) in notional volume. Current penetration by high-performance chains is low, at under 10% of DeFi's total $120 billion TVL, but growing as traders shift from centralized exchanges. Year-over-year growth stands at 45%, driven by a 80% increase in perpetual futures volume on platforms like Hyperliquid.

Key market drivers include technological advancements in consensus mechanisms (e.g., parallel execution for TPS scaling), regulatory clarity in regions like the EU's MiCA framework encouraging on-chain trading, and user behavior shifting toward decentralized venues for reduced counterparty risk post-FTX collapse. Pain points encompass compute bottlenecks in shared execution environments, leading to network congestion during volatility (e.g., Solana's outages), high latency (minimum 400-500ms on global consensus chains) enabling arbitrage exploitation, and fragmented liquidity across chains, increasing CAC for apps.

Future outlook points to inflection points like widespread adoption of sub-100ms latency chains by 2026, enabling hybrid CeFi-DeFi models, and integration with AI for on-chain market making. Strategic risks include regulatory crackdowns on leveraged trading (e.g., potential US SEC actions), scalability failures under extreme loads, and competition from modular L2s eroding L1 dominance.

# Target Customer & Use Case

Primary customer segments include DeFi app developers (e.g., perp DEX builders at startups like 01 Exchange, typically 5-20 employees, concentrated in Asia and North America), institutional market makers (e.g., firms like Amber Group or Flow Traders, with $100M+ AUM, based in Singapore and Europe), and high-frequency traders (individual or small teams in crypto-native hubs like Dubai and Hong Kong).

Unmet needs revolve around dedicated compute isolation to avoid noisy neighbor issues, sub-millisecond latency for competitive quoting against CEXs, and seamless cross-app composability without proof overhead. Usage motivations center on reducing opportunity costs from latency-induced slippage (e.g., 1-2% per trade) and enabling complex risk engines that support cross-collateral margining, which current chains limit due to compute constraints.

This market is relevant now due to surging derivatives volumes (up 80% YTD per FXEmpire), post-2024 bull market liquidity demands, and the maturation of tools like TypeScript VMs attracting non-Solidity developers, expanding the builder pool from 250,000 to over 20 million.

# Competitive Landscape

Top players include Hyperliquid (L1 focused on perpetuals with custom consensus), Drift (Solana-based perp protocol emphasizing composability), Monad (parallel EVM L1 targeting general DeFi scaling), Sei (high-throughput L1 with order book primitives), and Aptos (Move-based chain for low-latency apps). Differentiators: Hyperliquid's tech moat in 100,000-200,000 TPS and 0.2s latency drives its business model of rejecting VC funding while allocating 70% to community; Drift leverages Solana's ecosystem for distribution to retail traders via composable lending; Monad focuses on parallel execution for EVM compatibility, targeting developers with high CAC via grants.

N1 positions itself by attacking via decoupled settlement-execution layers for per-app vertical scaling, enabling VM-agnostic environments (e.g., TypeScript, Rust) and ecosystem incubation with revenue shares, differentiating from competitors' generalized VMs through dedicated containers for apps like perps.

| Feature | Hyperliquid | Drift | Monad | N1 |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------|----|
| TPS Capacity | 100,000-200,000 | 5,000 (Solana-limited) | 10,000 | 200,000+ |
| Median Latency | 0.2s | 1.2s | 1s | Sub-1ms |
| Execution Model | Custom BFT consensus | Shared Solana VM | Parallel EVM | Decoupled containers, VM-agnostic |
| Business Model | Community allocation (70%), no VC; $571M 24h volume | Protocol fees, composable with Solana DeFi | Grants for devs, staking rewards | Revenue shares from incubated apps (e.g., 01 perp), network fees |
| Target Users | High-frequency traders, market makers | Retail perps users on Solana | EVM developers scaling DeFi | App builders needing isolated compute, institutions |
| Key Moat | On-chain order book speed | Ecosystem composability | EVM compatibility | Horizontal scaling without consensus overhead |
| 2025 Revenue Est. | $700M (from volume) | $50M (fees) | N/A (pre-mainnet) | $10-30M (projections) |

# Analyst Commentary

N1 addresses the gap in compute isolation and latency for apps requiring NASDAQ-like performance, where competitors like Hyperliquid face decentralization trade-offs (e.g., scaling validators degrades execution) and Monad prioritizes EVM over custom VMs. Tailwinds include institutional inflows (e.g., Hyperliquid's 80.3% YTD price growth signaling demand) and developer migration to multi-language support; headwinds involve execution centralization risks (e.g., single-server failures) and competition from established ecosystems like Solana.

Early signals show adoption via N1's $20M liquidity program with Amber, benchmarks of 50,000 TPS on testnets, and commitments from apps like 01 Exchange (backed by CMS, Flowdesk), indicating ecosystem traction with projected $10-30M first-year revenue.
