A little bit intro about myself. So my name is YiPing, and I have been with IOSG around two to three years, mainly focused on the infrastructure and AI investments during my time in IOSG, I invest in fala, the AI and T projects, Phoenix, FG, privacy layer two, and also, and also bravas, the ZK coprocessor project there, before joining IOSG, I was in Certik doing a smart contract audit there, a little bit by IOSG. So we started in 2017 we are crypto native. Found we are one of the largest and earliest investor from Asia to look into the crypto space. We backed lots of infrastructure projects for the fund. One, it's a 50 million fund we invest in in polka dots, near avalanche, fine coin, iotex, Mina, all this infrastructure, and we are also one of the early investors to look into the defi space. So we back synthetics, makerdao, we are seed investor for one inch later, we study our second Fund, which is a 100 million fund focused on the layer two scale and solutions, or period of like optimism and arbitrary and also ZK, of like ZK sync, Aztec, stockware, scroll and taiko are all our portfolios. We also invest in some ZK infracomte, like Re Zero, lurklabs, sealer now foundation and Ingo Yama. We also did some consumer investments on the triple E gaming studio, like aluminum sharp nail and big time. Now we are deploying our funds three, which is also a 100 minute fund. Focus, focus parts on the infrastructure, parts on the consumer. Stuff we did. We did eigenlayer eser files will rental and public on the restating side. We also did the monad on the parallel EVM for like ultra fast blockchain. And now, like our we have over 150 plus portfolio families, 60% in us, 20% Europe, 20% in Asia, most of it are infrastructure projects. Our check size ranges from 500k to 5 million. So we delete co lead or even like participate based our check size and confidence and I will pass to Sam to introduce himself.\r\n\r\nSam Wang  2:26  \r\nYeah, hi, nice to meet you. I'm Sam. I've been with iOS three for half year, and focus more on AI and recently in other ways. Oh, great\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  2:40  \r\nto meet you guys. Yeah, I don't know how much you guys know about about me, and sort of, and one, so I'll kind of give you know, high level intro, and then, yeah, happy to kind of answer sort of whatever question you guys have. I think you guys did have our materials, right? I think we shared that in advance. Okay, cool, yeah, so I guess, like, yeah. Quick background, been in crypto since like 2017 started building around 2021 knew my co founders basically for the last like eight plus years now, we actually got into this space at the same time and together, which was around 2021, so the first thing that we actually built was fully on chain order books on Solana. So that was kind of like our introduction to the whole world of low latency, high frequency on chain trading systems right at the time. You know, we worked very closely with all the major Solana traders and market makers like Alameda jump and so on and so forth, got to basically really understand the issues with running like a low latency, high throughput protocol on Solana, and even Solana that was arguably at the time, and still is today, one of The fastest and if not the fastest chain available. Still had basically two major issues that prevented us to bring our protocol to what we wanted to do, which was like, which was this, like, fully NASDAQ on chain vision, right? Basically, kind of like the two big issues that we noticed were, number one, you had huge limitations on on Compute. And number two, you had really bad latency issues. So what I mean by compute limitations on all the existing chains, right? They share all the apps in a single chain, share the same bandwidth on the same compute, right? So what I mean by that is like, if you have like, one app doing, let's, let's say on Solana, right? Solana has like 5k TPS if, like one app is squeezing like 4000 GPS, right? That means you have 1000 TPS left for everything else, right? So basically, you have this, this, this total set of of of bandwidth and compute that is basically being divvied up between everything that exists on your chain. And, you know, that's not how the internet works today, and that doesn't scale and and we saw that first firsthand when you, you know, when you have stuff like NFT mints taking down, like Solana, right? Like these kind of things, like, shouldn't happen, and especially in periods of volatility, that's like, really, bad for an order book and a margin system, right? So that's the first product, right? That's first problem. The second problem is latency. And so any l1 that is doing consensus right across the globe is going to have, like, a minimum four to 500 millisecond latency. You just can't get past that. And you would think that 400 millisecond latency is not that bad. But when you're dealing with actively market make order book, right, each millisecond that is more than the baseline latency on like a centralized venue is an opportunity to get barbed as a market maker, right? And so basically, we realized that, hey, there were these two big problems, like when Sui and Aptos were coming out, Evan was like, pitching us to come build an order book on them. And we were like, look, we can't do this because there, there are these two fundamental problems, right? Like the compute doesn't scale and the latency is not good enough, and so and so we just spent a lot of time sort of going further down the stack. And at that time, we were pretty familiar with Solana source code as well, and basically just start thinking about, is there a way that we can sort of re engineer and re architect the idea of of a blockchain right from the ground up, such that you're able to solve these two constraints? So really, you know, long story short, that kind of got us to where we are today, which is building on one at a high level, right? Like the goal of n1 is to solve these two issues, we do so by basically decoupling the settlement from the execution layer. So settlement layer is the one that's highly decentralized, right? And all it does is make sure that executions and transitions are secure and correct. The execution layer, on the other hand, can be much more centralized. All it does is basically execute as fast as it can, right? And the cool thing that we can do on the execution layer is we can also horizontally scale, right? What that means is we have one, let's say, order book application, in a single container, right? It can scale independently up to like, 100k plus PF. We can launch another container that's horizontal and running concurrently, right? And this one, you know, whatever, some other, let's say, some market making, automated market making application that can also run up to 100k plus TPS, all in isolation, right? And so basically, you can just keep adding nodes, and each app can basically have its own dedicated compute. You can still, like, run, you know, multiple apps in a single container, right? That's totally fine. But But basically, this gives you kind of this, like horizontal, sort of scaling ability, which, which solves this kind of compute problem. And so, yeah, and so I'll stop right there. Realize I kind of went on a huge monolog. Also had to talk about good and market timeline, stuff like that. But, yeah, I want to stop here to see if there's any initial questions, sure,\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  8:01  \r\nsure. Yeah. I also go through the deck. I think the focus is more on the perp, on the trading part. We want to be more scalable and also like lower latency. So regarding this, I think first some tactical question here. Want to discuss with you. I think the first is on the latency part. I noticed like there are lots of chains that want to be lower latency, but they either suffer on the finality part, how do you provide really fast finality, even you have a fast execution speed? And I think another part is some, sometimes people often miss, often misses on the indexer, on the RPC, because on that part, normally the latest they usually expect, like one, at least like 50 milliseconds, but sometimes I take right up to like several seconds on Ethereum, suck\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  8:47  \r\nup, sure. Yeah, no, for sure. So to your to the first part of your question on finality, so you're correct, right? So when we're talking about latency, we're talking about execution, confirmation latency, right? Which already, from that perspective, you're comparing that to like Solana nous and so on so forth, already way better, right? From a finality perspective, there's really two solutions, right? So number one is like, what your baseline hard finality is going to be? So that setting is really arbitrary, and kind of depends on how secure you think the validator set is, right. So the larger the validator set, and the faster they're able to reproduce the state, the more your confidence interval increases in your ability to say, okay, I can set the hard finality smaller right earlier on, because we're going to have a smaller validator set and progressively increase that boundary set. But because earlier on you have a smaller validator set, you're inherently going to have to start with a higher finality, right, but the goal is to be able to decrease that as you increase the number of validators, right? The other thing you can do is actually come up with basically, kind of like a validator attestation, right? It's like if, if a certain n number of validators, right, attest that this state transition is good, right? Then you can count that as finality beyond the baseline finality, right? So let's say you're trying to like withdraw from the network earlier on, and maybe you pay like a fee for like the validators to like allow you to fast withdraw, right? In that case, you could reach basically faster finality than what the, whatever the baseline finality would be. So that would be the answer on the finality side. With that being said, what I would say is, like, when you're talking to market makers and traders, the thing that they care a lot more about is actually just execution, right? Because that, like, what they care about is, like, if I'm interacting with an order book application, I just want to know if, like, if I send my trade, it's going to go through, right? And that just comes down to the execution latency rather than finality. And so that's like, yeah, that's kind of like the first part of the answer towards your question about RPC latency. You're absolutely correct in the sense that, like, Look, if our execution operators are in servers on Tokyo, and you're sitting in, like, North America, right? It's going to be like at least 50 millisecond, like round trip, right? Unfortunately, that's the case. But the cool thing that what we can do is we can actually allow people to co locate with our servers as well, and use that as like a revenue generating opportunity, right? And so, for example, some of the more latency sensitive market makers, we can basically sell them Co Location spots at that. It's basically instead millisecond latency, right? Because you're literally co located. The other cool thing that you can do as well is, if you think about it from like a network building perspective, right? Like you have an order book application, if you want to build and really sort of extending this, this kind of like defi vision, where it's like, okay, if we want really, really efficient, like fully on chain automated market making, what actually works really well in the system, because that, that market making engine is actually basically co located with the order book, right? And so you have an on chain automated market maker that could be even more competitive than, like, an off chain market maker, right? And so that creates, like, some pretty interesting dynamics. But, yeah, to answer your question, like, you know, there is network latency, but you know, if that gives the opportunity to also make money by allowing people to co locate.\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  12:18  \r\nNice, yeah, co locate is definitely a great design. On the RPC part, are you guys, like, building everything in house, or, like you are working with some, like, third party external indexers? Yeah. So\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  12:29  \r\ninitially we're just building everything in house, just because our system is, like, pretty bespoke, right? But we plan on working with more service providers as we go to mainnet and so on and so forth. Yeah?\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  12:40  \r\nYeah. Last year, actually, last year, I talked to Pangaea. They are building real a high speed indexer, and work with movements, work with some ultra fast train over there, like Mega is, I think they talk to their customer, very, very high, very high, very high, very positive word from the\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  13:00  \r\nOkay, nice, yeah. I mean, happy to chat with them. I think it's just like, the reason we're not working with anyone right now is just because we're making so many updates so quickly that, like, it would just be too much work for other people, because we're going to be changing a bunch of stuff all the time. And so we rather, like, know, the stable system, you know, get to name that, and then at that point it's like much easier to sort of onboard\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  13:24  \r\ncertain and also on the on the technical part, can you like touch more on the container side, like the I know, like, it's kind of like the layer one, layer two design, you have the consensus on the layer one and execution on the layer two. And also touch a little bit more on, like, how to scale the container. Is it like you and also like the trade off between the decentralization?\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  13:44  \r\nYeah, totally so, so, so the way the containers work is basically, we're the sole initially, we're going to be the only operators of all these containers, right? So, so people who want to deploy apps are going to go through us, right? And we're basically going to manage all the servers, right? So as an end developer, right? Like you're not, you know, you're not deploying your own roll up, you're not managing your own sequence or whatever. You're literally just launching an app in the same way that you're launching a smart contract on Ethereum, where you're launching a program on Solana, right? Like you'll go through our CLI, or we'll have, like, a vercel type interface where you deploy your app, and then really, like, the choice that you're making is just like, Okay, do I want this to be on a dedicated container, or do I want to put this on an existing, sort of generalized environment? And so, for example, instead of So theoretically, right, like, we could deploy like an UVM or an SVM in a container. But we're actually not doing that. We're actually doing we're actually building out a TypeScript execution environment, which we're calling MTS. And so the idea there is like you can basically build and deploy smart contracts in TypeScript, and that'll be kind of like a generalizable playground, where anyone can in the same way that EVM and SVM works, right? Like anyone who's deployed smart contracts there, and it's this shared environment. So that's what we're going to do with NTS. And so really, like the UX of the as a developer is like, Okay, one, two, whether you want to deploy on like an existing shared environment or in your own dedicated lane, right? And then you just deploy your application. We manage all the orchestration of all the containers, and because the containers are all part of the same operating network, which is our network, we can basically add like direct message channels from one container to another, which enables the actual composability aspect of things, right? Which is where you know the roll up Ethereum world kind of falls through, because if you're trying to send a message from one roll up to another, you have to do some type of consensus proof, right? Or some type of ZK proof to to validate your state in our system, you don't need to do that. You can basically have like, instant message passing between apps across different containers, and to your last question about, what was your last question? Again, decent point, right? So the basic trade off is just like, yeah, like, the execution side is going to be very centralized, but, but that's by design, right? And then the settlement layer is going to be more decentralized initially, right? Just because we're we're doing things progressively, like, it's going to be a smaller validator set. But the nice thing is, unlike hyper liquid, right, that does its execution in like a decentralized way, like if they massively decentralized, that's going to be very, very problematic for their execution performance. Right? For us, that's not the case, because the execution remains centralized by design, and the security which is actually secured by the decentralized network can grow in a more decentralized way without necessarily affecting the performance of the execution layer. And\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  16:44  \r\nalso, like on the container, if you want to deploy a new container, that that means you are you need to run a new node, even like you run for them,\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  16:52  \r\nyeah. So we would spin up a new server, basically,\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  16:56  \r\nOh, I see. So every container is a new server, and if they want to build some, like, smart contract stuff, then it means, like, deploy into existing container, yeah,\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  17:05  \r\nso they can, so it's like, super modular and flexible, right? So, like, you know, like, as an example, if, if you want your own, like dedicated container, but you really want to whatever, write your program in, like, SVM code, right? You can deploy an SVM in a dedicated container and deploy your application day, right? Like, if you really wanted to do that, but usually, like, for example, like, like, what we're doing right now, like, the first example of an app that's going to be using a dedicated container is our flagship perp, that's right, and they're running basically an order book specific, hyper performant rust space virtual machine, right? And so that that's not like SCM or EVM or whatever it's, it's, it's basically just an application specific code, right? And we're just running that in a server, like, there's no generalized framework around it.\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  17:59  \r\nAnd if I want to scale this container, like, how to do it? Like, scale one container?\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  18:05  \r\nYeah. So basically, if you're scaling containers less scaling a server, right? Like, if you want, like, if we want to run something that, like, is even more compute demanding, right? Like, we just get, like, a bigger and faster and more expensive box, right?\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  18:22  \r\nI see, I see, so it's not like, if we want to, well, for the for the container, if you want to scale, you need to train server to a more powerful one. You cannot, like, just add your node to the network and make it stronger. Correct,\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  18:34  \r\nyes, correct, correct. I mean, I like, there, there's like, I mean, that's an interesting question, right? Like, you could redesign your program in such a way that, like, you have one container that's running a certain part of your application that's more compute intensive, you have another container that's running another part like that. That is certainly like a way that you could design things, I think for now, like, we haven't. We just haven't gone like, we haven't explored that type of like design mechanism. Yet, I think the order book as an example is probably like one of the most like performance and complex application that we can think of, and that's just running on on a single server for now,\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  19:13  \r\nI see, I see, and if we want to do your like, do your own container, or kind of stuff like, people are playing around. Like, what's some popular customization choices?\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  19:24  \r\nYeah, so the main customization choice is really just like your development environment, right? So, like, the nice thing about having your own dedicate container is, for example, like the order book stuff is what I was saying. Like, you can just write, you can just write your application in the way that you would actually code the code up the application without using some kind of, like, generalized framework, if that makes sense, right? So like, if I'm trying to build an order book on the EVM, I need to follow the rules of the EVM and then, like, try to make it fit into my app. But in this case, like, you just write the app directly, right? Like, you don't need to think about some other like esoteric like blockchain rules. This wouldn't be the case if you're, if you're launching on NTS, for example, you'll have to obviously follow, like, the TypeScript library and, you know, there's standards around token transfers and stuff like that. But if, if you have your own dedicated container, you just write your application however you want it to be, and our job is just to make sure that execution is happening trustlessly And that it's happening correctly, right? I\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  20:30  \r\nsee, and like, also on the container, on the performance. Because lots of blockchain, if we want to, they want to achieve high performance, they use like RAs, they use like go c+ environments. But now, like we kind of sell TypeScript, have our default environment. Is there any like execution, like performance impact over there? What kind of optimization we are working on? Yeah,\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  20:52  \r\nyeah. So just to be clear, each container is actually VM agnostic, and so TypeScript is our default, general purpose execution smart contract environment for our order book application that's actually in rust. So the order book VM is completely built in rust. And the goal down the line is to be able to support anything. So you'll be able to write in C, you'll be able to write Python and so on and so forth. Initially, for go to market and focus purposes, we're just starting with with the rust order book and TypeScript. That's more of kind of like a go to market choice. But down the line, the idea is fully family nous stick like you can run C, Python, blah, blah, blah.\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  21:39  \r\nAnd also, on the front end part. What kind of are we go with the EBM, that kind of front end framework compatible, or like Solana, part of our own?\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  21:49  \r\nYeah, really good question. So one of the key design choices that we made was that we did not want people to download a new wallet, right? Because that's like a huge like friction point for anyone to onboard to a new chain, and we wanted the onboarding experience to be super, super smooth, right? So, like, if you look at any LTO and Ethereum, I need to wait 15 minutes to deposit into the chain. Like, that's like, terrible, right? No one wants to do that. And so we actually thought a lot about the onboarding flow. So, so two things, right? One, we actually support both Ethereum and Solana based signature schemes. So you'll be able to basically use your Ethereum wallet or your existing salon wallet to connect to any app. And on top of that, what we're doing is we're actually building an in house wallet widget which all the which all of our apps are going to use, and that wallet widget is going to abstract away a lot of the onboarding and bridging complexities. So basically, the wall, which is that we built, is going to allow people like, let's say you've never interacted with the n1 chain before, right? You go on to an app that is on that is on n1 right? You don't need to go to any other bridge. You just stay on this app. And you can use the wall the like you open up your Connect Wallet button. It opens up a model, and through that, you can move your funds directly into the app from Ethereum slot and blah, blah, blah, without needing to ever go to, I don't know, like some third party bridge or whatever, right? So really, like, the key goal for us is like, how do you make it as easy as possible for people to onboard? The other thing that also enables this is, we're actually building a native bridge, initially, through Solana, and so assets are going to onboard directly from Solana, as opposed to Ethereum. And the reason for doing that is, is what I was alluding to earlier on, which is, like, if you're onboarding assets from Ethereum, you're gonna have to wait 15 minutes for it to finalize, right? Whereas, like, on Solana, it would be a few seconds. And so the UX for a user that's using that's trying to deposit into an app on n1 is going to be like, a few seconds of onboarding, rather than, like, waiting like 15 minutes. So, yeah, yeah, I see,\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  24:01  \r\nyeah, before I also chat with some, like, multi VM project over there in the past, like last year, like, it's kind of popular ideas, and we love the idea, like DJ, and want to deploy all kinds of smart contract on one single chain, like, even, like, it's a Solana one or Eclipse so compatible is like, your shining point for multi VM projects. But the problem is, like the front end compatibility, like the signature, like scheme over there, is kind of tough to handle on the consensus level, to be compelled with all this EVM, SVM signature, but you guys did it. Yeah, congratulations. Nice. Another question is around, like, the reliability, because, as you mentioned, like all the other containers somehow running in one single server, that means, like, if this single service down, then everything, like, is offline.\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  24:53  \r\nYeah, no, totally, um, so we're basically running, like very typical, like web two uptime protocols, right? So, like, you'll have backups running concurrently, right? And so if ever the main server goes down, you'll be able to switch very, very quickly to, like, a backup set of servers, right? I\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  25:11  \r\nsee, yeah, I think the whole idea is a little bit different from, like, a traditional blockchain. Like, well, one program like, is forming two different nodes, but this one definitely, I think, is more modern, and it's definitely designed for high performance application over there. Um, yeah. And also, on the a little bit high level question, because, like, from, from the position from what we want to achieve is kind of similar to hyper liquid, right? They're also expanding the infrastructure and building the ecosystem around that. Like, how do you compare with them? Like, what do you learn from hyper liquid in the past?\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  25:44  \r\nYeah, no, 100% I think our whole go to market strategy is also very, very similar to hyper liquid. Basically, like, the main learning is you are in like, we are in a time where tech doesn't matter as much, like, you can build the, and I'm talking about in the context of building an ecosystem, right? Like you can have really, really good tech, like, and people are not just gonna, like, um, build here because you have good tech, right? Like, the like, really, really good founders. They they actually care a lot more about users, distribution, liquidity, right? And so our job, outside of having really good tech, is actually to build a platform that has really that has a lot of users and liquidity like that's what we're solving for, and that's what hyper liquid got right, which was focusing on attracting a lot of use real users, not like fake farm users, and a lot of real liquidity. And then once they had that, right, then you can expand your ecosystem, and then people will naturally want to build there, because that's what they want, right? They want to build apps that can serve real users and liquidity. And so in the same vein, like our good and market strategy is very, very similar, right? We're only working with a few specific teams, some of which we're actually incubating. And these are apps that we have very, very high conviction, that they will have very clear returns on attracting real users, liquidity or volume, right? So as an example, the first app that we're going to be launching is a co incubation between us, Amber and and this and this founding team on a flagship purpose called 01, right, and and. And the founding team is actually probably like the like outside of Jeff from hyper liquid, he's probably like the best person you can find to build a perp x like this guy is, like one of the biggest CT traders was, individually, one of the biggest market makers on dydx. Him and his kind of like circle of traders, they're doing roughly like 10% of hyper liquids volume today, right? Which is an insane number to put into perspective, hyper liquids doing 700 mil in annual revenue, right? They are contributing to 70 million of that annual revenue, right? And that's revenue that's like, not volume, right? Like, the volume is even higher than that. So, and this is the guy who's who we're working with, and we talked with over, like, 100 plus per teams. Most of them are not built by real perp traders. Like once, once we met this guy, like, it was, like, clear as days that, like, this was the right person to work with, and so and so, that's, for example, like, one of the first, like, the first app that's going to launch. And we had very, very strong conviction that will be able to attract a lot of real users and volume just through that, right? And then the key idea is to launch back to back, a few other incubations that will be able to continue to drive that real usage and real liquidity, right? So for example, where we're incubating an HLP cell vault product with a market maker based out of New York, right? We're working with some ex wheel line engineers on a new bar lending protocol that'll leverage more advanced risk mechanisms, right? We're working with a consumer founder on Tap Tap trade, which is a mobile gamified options protocol, right? And the goal is, how do you abstract away the complexities of leveraged instruments to feed these like very gamified like trading products to retail that that loves it, right? And And conversely, like market makers love non toxic flow. And so the idea is like, again, taking a playbook, a page from hyper liquids playbook, which is launch apps that people actually want to use, right, drive real users, real liquidity, right, build up that platform, and then open up your permissionless mainnet such that now people will want to build here, right? And you're not, like, attracting people based off of incentives or whatnot and so and so, yeah, so, so that's kind of our strategy, and I think, I think our edge compared to hyper liquid is really in the fact that we get to focus entirely on the network and ecosystem side of things, and we have a dedicated team working on the exchange, whereas hyper liquid is a super small team trying to do both things right. And on top of that, their actual E and blockchain is going to be really problematic for the exchange, right? Because if they keep scaling the node set, it's gonna be really bad towards the end performance of the exchange. And so it's really hard for them to actually do the ecosystem playbook, whereas for us, we're very, very well positioned to scale that ecosystem and also have a really, really top contender in the perp deck space, right?\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  30:41  \r\nI see um. And also on the liquidity part, I noticed, like, you guys work with Amber. We work with flow traders and some like, great market maker over there. Like, how, how do you leverage that? Because that was an chain perp. Like, local is a main major like, things people should work on. And how do you ensure like you get higher liquid, more liquid than hyper liquid? Yeah,\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  31:06  \r\ntotally so. So Amber has a an agreement with 01 to provide liquidity to same depths as hyper liquid. Binance by bit. Right on top of that, the again, like the founding team themselves, they used to be like the biggest market makers on dydx, right? So it's not like they don't have capital to deploy into their own order book as well, which is basically what Jeff did in the early days, right? So from a liquidity side, like it's very well constructed\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  31:39  \r\nI see. And also on the can you talk more about like, 01, because that's kind of the major ecosystem play. Like, I assume they will capture like, 80% of the business value for like, for one and like, how do they plan to do the last thing with their business model there, and any new innovation stuff they want to bring to the market?\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  32:01  \r\nYeah, you're talking about 01, the perfect X, yes,\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  32:05  \r\nyeah.\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  32:05  \r\nSo I would say there's, there's two parts to that, right? Like, one is in terms of, like, what are the the unique new things that 01 is thinking, right? And then two is like, how does that then translate into our growth as the network, right? And value capture and the general growth of the network itself, right? So, on the first topic, right, in terms of 01, so one. So there's two things that we're basically focusing a lot on, on the feature set, right? One is novel types of markets, specifically markets that allow you to basically, like, compose one market with another, right? So, like, think about like tokenized, like delta neutral markets, or like goals over Bitcoin markets, right? Like these, like, very, very exotic and esoteric, like markets that we wouldn't see elsewhere, right? So Go, go even further than simply pre launch. I think pre launch markets was, like, really innovative, but you can go even further, right? And so that's what 01 is thinking about. And the second thing is, like, just better and more complex, like margining system, right? So like cross margining system that also allows for cross collateral, right? So like hyper liquid right now only accepts like USDC, and then I think they're now starting to accept, like Bitcoin and a few others like, you can go even further than that and allow many, many more collaterals, which is what FTX used to do, and people used to like that a lot, right? So basically, having, like, a much more robust margining system there too. The more interesting thing to me is, like, okay, like, how is the rest of the ecosystem also benefit and further, like, build up the moat around 01 right? So I think really, like, when you, when you think about the question around, like, how does a perp X, like, sustainably last for the next 10 years? And we don't just cycle between new perp Texas every, like, two years, right? They need to keep the key point there is liquidity lock in effect, right? So if you have liquidity that is being recycled and composed across multiple different venues, that makes it a lot, lot harder to move from one venue off to another, right? And that's really a lot of what we're trying to focus on with, with the ecosystem growth side, right? So, like, for example, working with a separate market maker on a vault that composes onto 01 right? Working with a gamified options protocol to potentially have RFQ and options trading that can then also eventually be embedded in the order book as well, right? And just really thinking about, like, how can you have, like, a margining system, right? That's universal, and that you can then have liquidity be shared across multiple venues, right? So really, kind of, like locking in that liquidity across these different venues and these different protocols, right? And then the last thing I'll mention is, like, okay, like, let's say, like, you know what? Why would 01 you know, accrue all the value to themselves and, you know, maybe one day they just run off, right? So, and that's what we saw with like dydx and starkware, right? So, to actually, so a point against that is actually, so we actually have really strong economics with 01 so like us as Zen one, because we co incubated this right. And so we actually have, like, a pretty decent stake in equity and token ownership of 01 and we also have a revenue sharing agreement in with 01 and so that allows us to basically also be highly highly, to have a lot of upside in the success of 01 and also directly drives revenue from their success. I\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  35:46  \r\nsee, I see, yeah, I think that's kind of also, also pretty similar to the defi part, right? For defi composable, it's like defi protocol enable each other, like the margin parts, like, like collateral stuff, pretty similar on the tokenomics parts, like, or there are something you are doing to drive the revenue back to the token. If, like, I saw the revenue projection there, it looks pretty good. Yeah,\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  36:11  \r\ntotally. So two things, right? Or two things at a baseline. So at a baseline, the token will serve one security purposes, where it's improved stake and then two transaction fees, right? But those are very like basic baseline things I think all networks do. The thing we're very and more excited about is actually driven revenue that flows back into the network. So what I was hinting at, for example, 01, and some of the other incubations that we're doing is we're getting the revenue sharing agreements right. So, like, it's, it's not like our thesis is, like, in five to 10 years, these are going to compress to zero on the infra side, right? Because people don't want to pay infra fees, right? And you see this with cloud computing and so on and so forth. And really, like, where the fees are being made is on the front end, right? You look at all these, like TG bots, right, training terminals, like exchanges, like wallets, they're making all the fees, right? So really, like, the key positioning for us is okay, how do we make sure that we position ourselves in such a way that we also capture that fee and then drive that back into the network to create this highly incentivized like network of participants, right? So as an example, like the revenue share from 01 obviously, initially it's going to go to our company, but we're actively thinking of ways where that revenue can flow back into the network, right? And if, by doing so, you're basically like one of the first networks that act that's actually flowing app revenue back into the into network participants, right? And then on top of that, I mean, just to kind of highlight or the way the philosophy that we think about things is like we see, we see the correct approach to building out an ecosystem much more like like, the way Apple is doing it, versus like Android, right? In the sense that, like, you want to be heavily involved in the the applications and services that are that everyone is going to be using, and you want it to be super well integrated, and you can capture revenue off of that, right? So think, like, Apple Music, Apple TV, like those type of, like default applications. And so that's kind of like how we think about it. And I think the more interesting token value approval, network value approval component is going to be like application revenues flowing back into the network. Yeah, I think\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  38:30  \r\nthis one is is more sustainable and healthy compared to like MeV, like all the over there. This one feels more, I would say, up to focus like it reminds me all the FinTech companies, they charge you a subscription fee and take the cost of the revenue, right?\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  38:48  \r\nExactly, yeah, no. I mean our thoughts is, like, MeV is, like, pretty stupid. Like, no, like, no one wants MeV. Like, the only people that want MeV is the MeV extractors. Like, no one else wants MeV, right? So, like, like, yeah. I mean, that's, that's our thoughts, yeah, great,\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  39:06  \r\nyeah. I think we have four minutes left. So let's jump into the fundraising. One, like, what's our like, valuation, how much we want to raise? Who already commits? What's a timeline? Something like, regular, yeah, for\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  39:21  \r\nsure. So, yeah, so we're doing basically a strategic round right now. We're actually closing the round end of this week. The goal of this round was to have it be very small and strategic focused, right? And so we're not raising a lot. Our dilution target is roughly 4 million on an 80 million valuation, right? So I don't know if you guys know this, but we did an echo round not too long ago, which was kind of the reason why we wanted to do the strategic we did that. We did a 2 million echo raised that sold out in like, literally a few seconds. We had over 10 million in demand, but we only sold 2 million, and at this point we're pretty over committed on the 4 million target as well. So really, like, the goal for us is just like, at the end of this week, we're going to, like, stop sort of talking to people and accepting checks, and we're going to finalize on on who to allocate to. And the main priority for us is very much strategic, like we're our goal is to find people that we we can see ourselves working with strategically for the next 10 years, right? And those are the people that that, that we kind of want to work with. So, so yeah, so that's kind of like, yeah, how we're thinking about the route\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  40:41  \r\nright now, and also for the TG is like a q2 and q3 right? So\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  40:46  \r\nwe're, we're so the T GE, right? Ask the risk like depending, it depends on a lot of factors, right? But our goal is to launch mainnet in one to two months with our first few apps, and then depending on how things go, depending on market conditions, potentially TG could be as early as q4 this year. Um, again, ask risk, depending on how things go. Um, earliest would be q4 this year, I see. And\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  41:16  \r\nalso for the uh oh, wait for the their one for the perp exchange, are they like also doing a separate race fundraising in the past? Or Yeah,\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  41:25  \r\nso they they raised a pre seed round from CMS Amber flow desk, I think a few months ago already, and I think they're planning on doing like, another round fairly soon. That's more institutional focus I see,\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  41:45  \r\nI see. And last question, like, because we focus on the user trading part, like, Do you have any like, observation regarding recent user speculation trading, like, PubMed phone, they are doing DG real soon. Like, believe app is doing super hard. And also we have some other stuff, like virtual Genesis, Launchpad. So there are so many things happening on the trading space. Like, what's your observation there?\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  42:10  \r\nYeah, for sure. I mean, I think there's like, like, in the trading game, there's really two large customer service sectors to focus on. One is, what I would say are the more perp type traders, right? The ones that do a lot of volume across per purpose changes. There's actually not that many of them. So if you look at like hyper liquid, hyper liquid has roughly like three to 4000 active users, doing like 700 million revenue for hyper liquid, right? Which is, like, huge, like that. The amount of volume per trader is huge, right? And so it's really like a VIP management business, right? Like, the question is, like, do you know all the whales and all the CT traders who are actually doing all this trading, and can you build the relationships to bring them onto your exchange? Which is why, again, we're like, super bullish on 01 because of that. So, so that's, like, one customer segment. The other customer segment is, is the more speculative meme coin type traders, right? Which is, which, which falls into the whole categories like virtuals and so on and so forth. Pumped off one, obviously. So there's, there's two plays that we're doing there. One is around gamified trading. Like, I think the big opportunity here is in creating, like, really gamified and simplified trading user interfaces, right? That allow people to go on leverage without needing to think about how, like, without needing to do the math, right? I think like, that's basically like, the biggest barrier for a lot of like for, let's just take like options as an example. Like, the biggest barrier for why options, they gain adoption is because it's just too complicated, right? People want things are simple, right? That's why meme coins got so much adoption. Because it's, it's not complicated to reason about like, like, speculating on meme coins, right? And so the goal with the gamified options thing is, like, side away all the complexity of leveraged instruments, but give people like these, like, basically, like, Game of five interfaces, right? That makes it super simple and super fun to trade leveraged instruments. And then the other thing is, like, thinking about better versions of meme coins, right? So there's another incubation that we're working on, which is also thinking about, Okay, I will design a new type of meme coin, right? Or a new type of category of coin that is actually more pegged towards, like, actual attention, and not like, based off of like liquidity games, which is, like, how pumped up fun works today, right? Like, pumped off fun today is, like, like, like, don't get rubbed Right? Like, find the right devs. Or liquidity pools, right? Which is, like, not what you want to be doing, right? Like, you want to think about, like, Oh, if, like, if suddenly, like, like, this meme gets really popular the news, like, it's actually going to go up, and I'm not going to get robbed, right? And so we're thinking of a new mechanism there as well to incubate.\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  45:06  \r\nI see, I see, yeah, it's almost time. But I want to share some of my random thoughts regarding, like, recent observation on the like, trading, all the speculation parts, I think definitely people are moving into direction on the developer side. First is looking for new type of assets, like, mind share. Like, there are some synthetic assets over there, but I feel like people are like, spend lots of time there, but none of them, like, get really popular at this moment. And also, there are people talking about low tail assets, last sale model, quality, long tail assets. But it turns out it doesn't work well, it seems. And another part I think people are working on is on the live streaming part, try to add more social feature there. I think live streaming actually should, to me, is like, feel like the right path. To me, it's not like gamified, or more liquidity makes trading happen. Well, on the purpose side, yes, boundless, big speculation side, no, it's not liquidity. It's not gamified. It's more on the personal connection, like mental connection. People want to do the speculative if they feel comfortable with that. For example, for the live streaming, if you see like the streamers are playing Call of Duty, you definitely want to bet on his token, because you are mentally connected. If he is killed, you feel that you lose something that's kind of mental connected, and you will see the token price down when the when the streamer is killed. So I think that's kind of the direction now. I think I'm more confident on mental, connected, social stuff. That should be the next direction. I think we want to focus on, but, yeah, but that's kind of the my random thoughts predicts that green. Yeah. Yeah,\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  46:41  \r\nno, for sure. I think live streaming is hugely under explored. And I think especially in like, the DJing training circles, like, like the Korean live streamers are insane. And so yeah, I think like, yeah, that area is definitely really interesting, for sure.\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  46:59  \r\nYeah, Sam, do you have any more questions?\r\n\r\nSam Wang  47:05  \r\nWould you have, like, a meeting afterwards, or maybe could I have a few minutes for follow up? Yeah,\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  47:10  \r\nI have a call in 10 minutes. So yeah, I but I can do like I stopped 10 minutes. Yeah. So\r\n\r\nSam Wang  47:16  \r\nsure question. So are you an Dima, also founder of 01\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  47:24  \r\nYeah. So we so that that was the order book on salon that we originally started. So it was also called 01 and then we shut it down when Alameda blew up and and basically we're reviving it now under, under Dustin. So we're, we're not running it anymore, but Dustin's gonna pick it up.\r\n\r\nSam Wang  47:45  \r\nYeah. So is it like, also, you know, like managing them. It's like, delegated to them, but, like, have some partnerships, right?\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  47:55  \r\nSo, so it's a, it's a separate team, so they have their own entity. It's very much separate, but we do have like a stake in their equity and token because we are co incubating it. So we're, we're working very closely, but it is a separate team, and we're not like, yeah, it's not like a sub team under us.\r\n\r\nSam Wang  48:16  \r\nI see, I see, also curious on the echo run, or is there like a valuation for the echo role.\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  48:21  \r\nYeah, basically same thing as the strategic So, like 80 mil.\r\n\r\nSam Wang  48:26  \r\nI see, I see, also curious, like, I think, since one is going to enable high compute, what do you think because of an one's possibility of being labeled this high compute has a help, like 01 to achieve certain features. I think you mentioned on cross margin. Or do you have, like, more opinions because of this high compute? What's this new like, prep desk? Could be able to do what is like, previously impossible?\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  48:59  \r\nYeah. So I think basically, like, the immediate thing is really just like the margin and risk system, right? Like, if you're able to run more complex math, like, you're just inherently going to be able to build a much more robust risk engine, right? And I think especially if you're thinking about cross margining it with other products, like structured products, options and so forth. Like, that's like, actually a non trivial amount of math that you need to do on chain. So, like, patent effect cookie is actually very, very important to have, like, an efficient, marginally system, right? The margin system is important because in theories of volatility, you want your risk and liquidation engine to, like, basically kick in very, very quickly, right? And that's really like, where most of the more poorly designed exchanges fail, right? Like is, it's in those periods of volatility where, like, your margin system is really tested, and then you have, like, one really bad loss, and it's game over, right? And so that's what I would say, is the biggest like edge, right? But I think, like, outside of 01, itself, like there's full category of financial applications that are just so much better with more compute. So the natural second example is market making, right? So, like, the whole reason why x, y k was even invented was because, like, Ethereum is just so, like, compute is so expensive on Ethereum that I can't put in more variables in the equation, otherwise it's just gonna get more too expensive, right? Like, if you actually brought this to, like, a tradfi market maker, like, they're not gonna take you seriously for using x y k, right? And so even just x, y, k alone, like, let's say, like, you can come up with a market making algorithm with 20 parameters, right? That is going to be, like, the magnitude more efficient than, like, a three parameter like market making algorithm, right? And so, in the same vein, right? Like the risk system and the marching system for borrowed lending protocols as well. Like, you can offer better rates at high and higher riskier assets if you have a more efficient liquidation system, right? So really, like thinking in that fame like, I think there's a whole class of like, basically anything that involves risk, right, is improved when you have increasing compute.\r\n\r\nSam Wang  51:18  \r\nI see, are these like, complex logic. Are they like? Is it like necessary to they have to be put on chain? Is there, like, any ways that you could, like, do some off chain computations, but maybe just, like, make the final decisions on chain? What are the like biggest difference?\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  51:34  \r\nYeah, so, like, the cool thing with the design in our network, right, is like, you can run, for example, like an alvenida stojkov method, which is like a pretty, like, widely studied, like Trad file, like market making algorithm fully on chain. And have that be basically like co located with the order book. And as such, you have really, like a neutral market maker, right, that anyone can provide liquidity to that is non extractive, right? Because everyone knows its only purpose is to provide liquidity on chain in a trustless way, right? So I think, like the whole vision of like defi was like, Hey, we can, like, basically build these like core primitives that just create, like an automated financial system where no one is actually trying to extract from anyone, right? And so I think like with this, you really have that the opportunity to actually do that right, when you sort of remove this off chain component, then you can really trust that, like the market maker is not trying to extract and it's basically just providing liquidity, right? But it's providing liquidity in a way that's both beneficial to the liquidity providers, because it's not x, y, k, and you're not bleeding out in permanent loss. But it's also beneficial to the actual takers, because you're able to quote like pretty tightly and efficiently, right?\r\n\r\nSam Wang  52:51  \r\nI see, I see, also curious, like, what do you think of like, besides finance, how this like, high compute, low latency could like benefit from maybe, like, from other fields, maybe, like, AI, what's your thoughts on that?\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  53:07  \r\nOh, yeah, 100% I mean, like, I think other fields benefit a lot, right? Like, even if you think about, like, gaming, right? Or like, you said, like, AI, like, one thing we've been thinking about is also, like, you know, running, like, full AI models on chain and what that would look like, right? The only reason we're just, like, hyper focused on trading and finance right now is just from a pure go to market and business decision. It just makes a lot more sense for us to catalyze a ton of liquidity and volume early on before sort of expanding our breadth of focus. But absolutely right. Like, there's like, really, like, like, I think in any vertical, you can think of ways where more compute can increase the types of features and things that you can do and offer to your users.\r\n\r\nSam Wang  53:57  \r\nI see, I see, I'll have more questions. And\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  54:00  \r\nalso, like on the previous round valuation, what was our previous round valuation for later round?\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  54:08  \r\nYeah, so our seed round was led by Founders Fund that was a 40 mil FTV round.\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  54:16  \r\nWhen does it happen? That\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  54:19  \r\nwas end of 23\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  54:22  \r\nand who is leading this round?\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  54:25  \r\nWe don't. It's not a traditional sort of round structure. So, yeah, yeah, it's like just strategics, yeah,\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  54:35  \r\nwho committed this round?\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  54:38  \r\nUm, so we haven't conf so we haven't confirmed allocations for most people who've committed. So I can, I can tell you who I've we've confirmed so far. That includes some of our seed investors, like Kraken Saul Amber. We've drawn some new people like IMC ice, Turkey, Roshan from TAC, Sean from Ida, which is one of the only like Hong Kong licensed stablecoin providers, Seb from from sandbox, everyone else were, we still haven't confirmed their allocation, and so I wouldn't want to tell you a name, and then, you know, we end up not taking them. But yeah, the goal for us is, like, end of this week, we're going to finalize, like, who gets what amount of allocation, and at that point, like, happy to share the full list,\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  55:30  \r\nand what's the valuation for the 01 well, last 1001,\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  55:37  \r\nI'm actually not sure what zero one's valuation was. Yeah, I would have to go ask them.\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  55:44  \r\nUm, yeah. I think, also regarding the timeline, what we we have, like is, we will, we can have an IC discussion this week so we can provide some preliminary, preliminary feedback if we want to do the further DD, or we don't want to participate in this route, if we want to do the further, dd, we will do another presentation like next week so we can finalize our investments decision. If we want to particularly participate in this run in like two or three week.\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  56:14  \r\nOkay, um, okay. So if you can wait, when's your guys's? IC,\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  56:22  \r\nwe have I see on every Thursday. But if we want to invest in on normal, it takes like, two round of discussion,\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  56:30  \r\nokay, okay, two rounds of that's like internal discussion or like, okay, okay, okay, got it if, if you can, yeah, if you can, let me know after your Thursday I see just temperature check right and how you guys are thinking. I think the most important thing for us is we need to know like, whether it is like, like, if you guys are like, actually like, what the chances are that this is actually gonna cause, like, we wanna finalize allocations end of this week, we wouldn't want to be like, Okay, you guys wanted, I don't know, whatever. Let's just say 200k right? 200k and then we say no to someone else, but then a week later, you guys say no, then it's like, it gets weird, right? And so we know it would have to be pretty high confidence interval. And ideally, if you can let me know what the check check size is and ranges, what would be important? Yeah, I\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  57:28  \r\nsee Yeah, for the check size, like our minimum check size is like 500k by normal 1.5 million. I think that's kind of the normal check size.\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  57:39  \r\nOkay, okay, got it, okay, yeah, so, so, because that's also like a larger check size, like, yeah, definitely give me the, give me the temperature check end of Thursday and, and we can kind of, yeah, go from there. Sure, yeah,\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  57:54  \r\nabsolutely, yeah. Thanks for that. Yeah.\r\n\r\nDavid Cao  57:58  \r\nOkay. Okay, cool. Thanks, Sam, thanks. YiPing. It was great. Meeting you guys. let me know if any other questions. Yeah,\r\n\r\nYiPing Lu  58:04  \r\nthank you David. See you,\r\n\r\nSam Wang  58:06  \r\nthinking about.\r\n\r\n\r\n</meeting note>\r\n\r\n<whitepaper>\r\n--- PAGE 1 ---\r\n\r\nN1: LITEPAPER\r\nAbstract\r\nWe present a novel layer 1 blockchain with decoupled settlement and execution layers. The settlement layer is horizontally scalable, and specially implemented to enable the execution layer to provide per-app vertical scaling. Scalability is achieved through removing the need for consensus for key primitives such as data availability and proof verification, using (unordered, asynchronous) set replication instead of (ordered, partially synchronous) log replication. Overall transaction bandwidth increases with the number of validators without compromising security. Each application is a specialized virtual machine in the execution layer operating independently and asynchronously, and communicating through message-passing. Applications can choose a variety of security mechanisms with specific security guarantees, such as succinct validity proofs, trusted execution environment attestations, and consensus. We believe that this decoupled architecture will enable a new paradigm of apps that could not exist elsewhere.\r\n1. INTRODUCTION\r\nN1 is a custom-built, minimal layer 1 blockchain designed to support clusters of decoupled, high-performance, application-specific virtual machines. It addresses the blockchain trilemma by decoupling consensus from execution to support horizontal scalability of the settlement layer, all without compromising security. This decomposition enables a clear separation of concerns, allowing for independent optimization and innovation across the execution and settlement layers. The execution layer facilitates state machines with arbitrary transition rules over opaque state, while the settlement layer provides essential functionality for registering and operating execution environments.\r\nOur first key contribution is the settlement layer providing security to offchain applications. The key observation is that several primitives required for decentralized applications, such as data availability and transition verification, do not require consensus. Instead, asynchronous broadcast over a quorom is sufficient for security. We build on this to enable horizontal scalability of data availability and proof verification, limiting consensus to operations that require it. Not only does security scale with the number of validators, but so does total available bandwidth and compute.\r\nOur second key contribution builds on the first, defining a novel execution layer. By decoupling execution from consensus and enabling parallel data availability, we enable a novel design for execution where all apps operate asynchronously. There is no notion of state contention nor locking, as apps interact through messages just as they do on the internet. Using this, we also present a crossapplication communication scheme that does not require light clients for message validity, enabling millisecond latencies and high throughput.\r\nThis work derives from our experience building decentralized exchanges as Layer 2 (L2) protocols on Ethereum, exceeding 100K transactions per second with eventual finality. To achieve this, we leveraged two key primitives:\r\n- High-throughput data availability services to remove the transaction bandwidth bottleneck.\r\n\r\n--- PAGE 2 ---\r\n\r\n- Optimistic settlement with non-interactive fault-resolution [1] to remove the latency and compute bottleneck. To do so, we pioneered the use of succinct- validity fault-proofs.\r\nDespite this, limitations from the Ethereum settlement layer still leaked to the Layer 2. Settlement latency significantly impacts L2 finalization time, and arbitrarily long transaction backlogs are unsustainable. This was especially pronounced during periods of high gas fees. Even 1 MiB transaction blocks to data availability still result in frequent settlement updates on every Ethereum block. Both bandwidth and latency constraints stem from consensus, finality, and noisy neighbour problems inherent to the Ethereum settlement layer. These issues are exacerbated as we scale the number of apps operating in a single trust zone. Apps within a single trust zone share common sequencing semantics to facilitate fast and efficient cross-chain communication. The more apps we pack into a trust zone, the greater the benefit of cross-app composition and shared liquidity.\r\nWe also observed high settlement and data-availability fees while operating our flagship high-frequency CLOB dex - NORD. Fig 1.4 shows a 4-hour run for NORD running at maximum throughput and optimistically settling state on Ethereum. We spent around 1.8 ETH a day on gas fees and the same amount of ETH on DA services. A full snapshot of our run can be found on the Ethereum mainnet for contract address - 42d0227d4fdc7712668cfb6b7be892013888d61d.\r\nOur key insight is that the two primitives used, data availability and transition verification, do not require consensus-based total ordering for security and finality. To secure an attestation, we can instead use a weaker primitive - asynchronous reliable broadcast [2], which consists of certifying a message among a supermajority of the validators. Additionally, as each application has a single writer, we can leverage this to enforce ordering, all without consensus. Thus, most operations never hit consensus.\r\n2. Protocol\r\n2.1. Settlement Layer.\r\nThe settlement layer provides the minimal feature set required for hosting a simple execution environment. Before explaining how users leverage N1, first, we define a glossary of terms used throughout the paper.\r\nset replication The network provides a set replication service, where clients can write a value $v$ to an account and later perform a read to get a set including $v$. Successive reads return a superset of the previous reads. If the account is controlled by a single writer, this essentially functions as a log as the client can use the nonce to maintain order. To write a value, a client broadcasts the value to all validators and collects the signatures to assemble a certificate of strong replication, using its own network resources. The proof is then broadcast again to the network, where honest validators ensure its inclusion. This sequence only assumes asynchrony. Set replication with a single writer is enough to implement accounting primitives like decentralized payments [3-5]\r\nlog replication Independently of set inclusion, the network maintains a log which unconditionally ticks every $\\Delta$ seconds and maintains a minimal state machine. The state includes current participants in the network, their authentication\r\n\r\n--- PAGE 3 ---\r\n\r\nkeys, and any information regarding messages to and from other ledgers for bridging. Unconditional tick serves as a random beacon that is used by other operations in the protocol, such as random leader election and data availability challenges.\r\nTo actually store the values submitted by clients, the validators provide a simple, hybrid storage model. Each account gets namespaced access to the key-value store and can expose arbitrary endpoints to mutate or query the account state. Each account chooses the consistency flavor for its key-value store. Ordered consistency is provided for accounts needing log-based replication, and set consistency is provided for accounts that only require set inclusion for their state.\r\nWe claim that this is sufficient to construct a decentralized application with security backed by the layer 1 network. As an illustrative example, consider running the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on N1 verified using succinct validity proofs. To provide security using the settlement layer, the operator will need to\r\n1. store transaction data with censorship resistance\r\n2. verify the transition proof using the transaction data and prior state\r\n3. bridge assets to and from other ledgers\r\nLet's break down how each of these requirements is fulfilled. The operator maintains an off-chain instance of the EVM alongside its ledger. Every few blocks, the operator batches this sequence of blocks into a single data availability blob and performs the set write. The validators in the network provide data availability commitment $\\mathcal{C}$ for the blob and ensure that the data remains available for the data availability period. The operator also computes a succinct validity proof $\\pi$ for the transition and performs a set write, where in this case the validators also verify the proof. Any client using the EVM instance is able to query the network for and verify both $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\pi$.\r\nTo bridge assets to and from other ledgers, the N1 ledger maintains an inbox and outbox of requests to each chain using the inter-blockchain communication (IBC) [6] protocol. To bridge assets in, the operator can include the light client proof of the deposit and mint the asset in the EVM instance, and to bridge assets out, the operator can use its own transition proof and push a message to the outbox. This mechanism can also be used for forced inclusion for censorship resistance, where the operator is forced to consume new messages from the inbox after a given number of layer 1 blocks and is dis-incentivized from censoring through slashing from the validators. Thus, while set replication provides safety, connecting it to the log via bridging provides liveness.\r\nThus, we've satisfied all the requirements. Notice that none of these operations other than bridging require consensus. This can be interpreted as the operator acting as the leader of its own ledger, but additionally with the validator set, preventing the leader from being Byzantine. Notice also that we've made few assumptions regarding the shape of the operator. The operator could be centralized for minimal latency, but could also be itself a consensus network for additional censorship-resistance guarantees. Additionally, since data availability is easily sharded, the vast majority of the data submitted to the network can horizontally scale without compromising security. We now build on this idea to show just how far we can scale the settlement layer.\r\n\r\n--- PAGE 4 ---\r\n\r\n2.2. Execution Layer.\r\nThe settlement layer can in practice run a multitude of execution layers, all interoperable and optimized for their specific use cases. N1 provides a canonical execution layer for applications which maximally exploits the novel properties of the settlement layer and is developed in tandem with it. The execution layer is decoupled from consensus, instead leveraging proofs to derive economic security from the validators.\r\nHere, we present our implementation of an execution layer designed for highperformance applications. The key innovation is that all applications operate completely asynchronously, without state contention or locks. There are certain classes of applications that require real-time responses, such as decentralized exchanges competing with traditional central-limit order-books, decentralized physical infrastructure networks, and gaming. Although the design is meant to eventually leverage succinct validity proofs, we additionally describe an interim optimistic architecture and how to detect and resolve faults in this asynchronous system.\r\nThe network consists of nodes we call processes. Between two process $p$ and $q$, there may be a directed channel $c$ which acts as a FIFO queue. We assume that channels are unbounded and error-free. Each process $p$ is equipped with a state transition function $\\gamma(S, a)$, where $S$ is the current state and $a$ is an action that transitions the state to a new state, and produces messages to be routed to other processes. For example, in the case of Ethereum, an action could be a block of transactions and $\\gamma$ would execution this block on an EVM instance on the current world state. Messages are all delivered asynchronously, i.e. they arrive within finite but unbounded real time.\r\nThe execution layer can be thought of as a massive state machine, where the set of actions consists of all actions for each process in the system and some linearization of those actions. The problem then becomes how to create a globally consistent sequence of state snapshots. We now describe the construction.\r\nFirst, each process $p$ independently acts as an application that settles to N1 just as in our example of the EVM in the previous section. Thus, each process' operator regularly batches transactions and performs writes to the settlement layer. The way we connect the processes is by introducing a new process $r$ which we call the root. The root is the process which is responsible for coordinating the collective snapshotting [7] of the entire network. We use a novel variation of the classic asynchronous snapshot to coordinate all process to take a snapshot of their state and all in-flight requests. Second, we define a notion of channel congruity, i.e. that in-flight channels are valid and are eventually delivered, and that each message is delivered exactly once or timed out.\r\nWe define two proof types:\r\n- state transition proofs, which prove that a process $p$ is abiding by its state transition function $\\gamma$. This is similar to the proofs used in the EVM example.\r\n- channel congruity proofs, which prove that the channels are behaving reliably, i.e. are delivering messages exactly once.\r\n\r\n--- PAGE 5 ---\r\n\r\nNotice that for any transition of the globally networked state, it's sufficient to either have a state transition proof of an invalid transition or a channel incongruity proof to disprove the whole transition. This follows from the contrapositive of the definition of a valid state transition proof for the full asynchronous system. Thus, until succinct validity proofs become efficient enough, it's possible to use this scheme to instead perform optimistic state transitions which nonetheless derive economic security from the settlement layer.\r\n3. CONCLUSION\r\nBy decoupling the settlement and execution layers to focus on removing consensus from the hot path, N1 provides performance and facilities not yet possible. The settlement layer is specifically design to scale to the current needs of decentralized applications, which our canonical execution layer maximally exploits. The scalability is possible thanks to providing an additional primitive, set replication as opposed to only log replication, which is sufficient for deriving safety and liveness from the validators. The execution layer is, unlike existing solutions, completely asynchronous. In other words, all applications run separately and without contention, instead communicating through messages. Since applications share the same trust zone, messages do not require mutual authentication, thus enabling immediate finality and in turn enabling new classes of applications that can exploit the real-time nature of communication.\r\nREFERENCES\r\n1.

It’s a fundamental pillar of how our world operates, and crypto is no exception. It drives market liquidity, supports innovation, and helps the entire ecosystem succeed. Without credit, growth and innovation are held back, limiting how much the market can develop.If we look at traditional markets, the unsecured business loans market size was valued at $4.3 trillion in 2021 according to a [report](\n\nhttps://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/unsecured-business-loans-market-A15157\n\n) from Allied Market Research, and is projected to reach $12.5 trillion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 11.7%.Meanwhile, the crypto lending space peaked at less than 1.5% of the traditional market’s volume in 2022. Although 2021 and 2022 highlighted the sector’s potential, it has since taken a significant hit, contracting by 90% year-over-year in uncollateralized lending. Let’s be honest: the outlook is bleak, and there’s no immediate sign of recovery. Instead, many in the industry are now repackaging another settlement layer under a new label — whether it’s “we only lend to market makers” or “we only lend to fintech companies in Latin America.” However, these approaches often overlook critical questions: Who will be the lender? What can you offer them to invest in your opportunities? How will you restore trust?We should start by analyzing the known market sizes of major players in the crypto lending space in 2022. This includes firms like Celsius, BlockFi, Genesis, and various DeFi lending platforms, which collectively represented approximately **$30 billion** in outstanding loans at their peak.However, this figure captures only a portion of the total market. To derive a more comprehensive estimate, we considered additional significant segments, including:- **Earning programs at exchanges**: Major exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken have their own lending desks, which contribute substantially to the total market volume.\n\n- **Lending books of other major players**: Companies like Nexo, Tether, and Galaxy Digital have substantial lending activities that are not always fully disclosed publicly.\n- **Undisclosed institutional lending**: Many transactions and loan agreements occur in less transparent settings, such as OTC, contributing further to the market size.Given the partial visibility of these operations and the dynamic nature of the crypto market, we conservatively estimated that these additional segments at least double the visible market size, leading to an adjusted figure of approximately **$60 billion**. If we compare this to the traditional finance unsecured business loans market, which is about $4.3 trillion, crypto lending accounts for a bit less than 1.5%.\n\n</output example>\n"

    "response": "# High-Performance DeFi Infrastructure & Trading Blockchain Market Overview\n\n## 1. Market Definition & Problem Statement\n\nThe high-performance DeFi infrastructure and trading blockchain market targets the execution of computationally intensive, low-latency financial applications—primarily decentralized perpetual (perp) exchanges, high-frequency trading, and advanced on-chain market making. The core problem: existing L1s (Ethereum, Solana, etc.) are bottlenecked by compute and latency constraints, making them uncompetitive for capital-efficient, institutional-grade trading and complex DeFi primitives.\n\n- **Compute Limitation**: Most L1s cannot support advanced risk engines, multi-asset margining, or sophisticated AMM algorithms due to low throughput (e.g., EVM: ~15 TPS, Solana: ~2,000–5,000 TPS).\n- **Latency Limitation**: Minimum confirmation latency on most L1s is 400–500ms (Solana), up to several seconds (Ethereum), compared to <10ms on centralized exchanges.\n- **Capital Inefficiency**: On-chain liquidity is fragmented, yields are lower, and pricing is less competitive than centralized venues.\n\n## 2. Market Size & Growth\n\n- **Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: The global crypto derivatives market reached ~$2.5 trillion in monthly trading volume (May 2024, Coingecko), with perpetuals accounting for 75–80% of volume. Centralized venues (Binance, Bybit, OKX) dominate, but on-chain perps (dYdX, Hyperliquid, Vertex, Drift) are growing rapidly.\n- **On-chain Perp DEX Revenue**: Hyperliquid reported ~$700M in annualized revenue (2024), with ~3,000–4,000 active traders. dYdX V4 (Cosmos) processes ~$1–2B daily volume, generating $60–100M annualized protocol revenue.\n- **Growth Rate**: On-chain derivatives DEXs have grown >100% YoY in volume since 2022, outpacing spot DEXs. Institutional adoption is accelerating, with market makers and quant firms seeking on-chain venues for transparency and composability.\n\n## 3. Competitive Landscape\n\n### Key Players\n\n| Project        | Execution Model         | TPS/Latency         | Key Differentiators                      | Revenue/TVL (2024)       |\n|----------------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Hyperliquid**| Custom L1, CLOB        | ~100K TPS, <1ms*    | In-house chain, sub-ms latency, CLOB     | $700M annualized revenue |\n| **Drift**      | Solana L1, Hybrid AMM  | ~2,000–5,000 TPS    | Hybrid AMM, composability, Solana UX     | $10–20M annualized rev   |\n| **Monad**      | Parallel EVM L1        | Target 10K+ TPS     | Parallelized EVM, EVM compatibility      | Mainnet not live         |\n| **N1 (ex-01)** | Decoupled L1, App VMs  | 50K+ TPS (bench), <1ms | Decoupled settlement/execution, VM agnostic, per-app scaling, TypeScript/Python/C/Rust support | Projected $10–30M 1st yr |\n\n*Hyperliquid’s sub-ms latency is for execution, not finality.\n\n#### Technical Differentiators\n\n- **Hyperliquid**: Custom L1, fully integrated CLOB, sub-ms execution, but execution decentralization is limited; node scaling impacts performance.\n- **Drift**: Built on Solana, leverages Solana’s composability and speed, but limited by Solana’s shared compute and network congestion.\n- **Monad**: Parallel EVM, aims for high throughput and EVM compatibility, but mainnet not yet live; technical risk remains.\n- **N1**: Decoupled settlement/execution, per-app vertical scaling, VM-agnostic (TypeScript, Python, Rust, C), horizontal scaling of settlement, sub-ms execution, composable message-passing without consensus bottleneck.\n\n## 4. Target Customers & Motivation\n\n- **Professional Traders/Market Makers**: Require low-latency, high-throughput, and composable venues to deploy advanced strategies, minimize adverse selection, and maximize capital efficiency.\n- **Institutions**: Seek transparent, auditable, and composable on-chain venues for derivatives and structured products.\n- **DeFi Developers**: Need flexible, high-performance backends (multi-language VM support) to build complex financial primitives (e.g., cross-margining, exotic derivatives, AI-driven market making).\n- **Retail Users**: Attracted by better pricing, deeper liquidity, and innovative trading products (e.g., gamified options, narrative trading).\n\n## 5. Market Trends & Future Projections\n\n- **Shift to High-Performance Appchains**: Custom L1s (Hyperliquid, N1) and parallelized L1s (Monad) are emerging to address the compute/latency gap left by general-purpose L1s.\n- **Institutional Onboarding**: Market makers (Amber, Flow Traders, CMS) are directly backing and providing liquidity to on-chain venues, driving real volume and reducing reliance on incentives.\n- **Composability & Cross-App Liquidity**: Platforms are building ecosystems where margin, collateral, and liquidity are shared across perp DEXs, vaults, and structured products, increasing user stickiness and TVL.\n- **Revenue Model Evolution**: Protocols are shifting from infra-fee capture (blockspace) to revenue-sharing with applications (e.g., N1’s equity/revenue share with flagship apps like 01 Exchange).\n- **Developer TAM Expansion**: VM-agnostic chains (N1, Monad) are targeting 20M+ developers (TypeScript, Python, C, Rust), compared to ~250K Solidity devs, accelerating ecosystem growth.\n\n### Future Projections\n\n- **On-chain derivatives DEXs** will likely surpass $100B monthly volume by 2026, with perp DEXs capturing >10% of total crypto derivatives volume.\n- **High-performance L1s** will become the default backend for institutional-grade DeFi, with capital efficiency and latency as primary moats.\n- **Revenue**: Top on-chain perp DEXs are projected to reach $1B+ annualized protocol revenue by 2026, with L1s capturing a significant share via revenue-sharing and native app fees.\n\n## 6. Key Metrics\n\n- **TPS/Latency**: N1 benchmarks at 50K+ TPS on Ethereum mainnet (slower than its own L1); target sub-ms execution latency.\n- **Revenue Projections**: N1 projects $10–30M in year one, with $8–16M from network fees (500–1,000 TPS at $0.0005/tx), $15–85M from revenue share (perp DEXs, vaults), and $0.85–3.4M from native apps.\n- **Liquidity Program**: N1 has secured a $20M liquidity program with Amber and other market makers.\n\n## 7. Conclusion\n\nThe high-performance DeFi infrastructure and trading blockchain market is rapidly evolving, driven by the need for capital efficiency, low latency, and composability. Projects like Hyperliquid, Drift, Monad, and N1 are pioneering new technical architectures to unlock institutional-grade on-chain trading. The market is expanding at >100% YoY, with perp DEXs and appchains poised to capture a growing share of the $2.5T/month crypto derivatives market. Key differentiators will be execution speed, developer accessibility, ecosystem liquidity, and sustainable revenue models.",
