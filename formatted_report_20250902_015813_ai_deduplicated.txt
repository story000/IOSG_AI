9. [XRP Price Holds Near $2.75 as Analyst Maps Path Between $2.40 Risk and $3.70 Upside](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/01/xrp-price-holds-near-usd2-75-as-analyst-maps-path-between-usd2-40-risk-and-usd3-70-upside)

XRP hovered near $2.75 on Monday, down 2.38% over 24 hours, as traders weighed key support and resistance levels flagged by crypto analyst Ali Martinez.In a post on Aug. 31, Martinez stressed that XRP “must hold above $2.77” or risk falling toward $2.40. His chart illustrated a clear floor around $2.77 that had previously attracted buying interest. Breaking beneath that zone, he suggested, would take away the safety net and leave the token vulnerable to deeper losses. For non-technical readers, the message was straightforward: $2.77 represents the line where bulls need to show strength, and if they don’t, the next major level of support sits all the way down at $2.40.In a post on Sept. 1, Martinez followed up with a more optimistic roadmap. His chart highlighted $2.70 as a crucial level to defend, a slightly lower support zone than before, and $2.90 as the barrier that XRP would need to break to turn momentum positive. If both conditions are met — holding the base and clearing the ceiling — his chart pointed to a potential rally toward $3.70. In plain terms, Martinez laid out a step-by-step path: first avoid slipping lower, then push through resistance, and only then aim for a larger breakout.CoinDesk’s 24-hour chart shows how this battle is playing out in real time. XRP reached as high as $2.8325 during the day before sellers pushed it back down, while the low of $2.7034 showed buyers stepping in to protect the lower end of the range. That tug-of-war between bulls and bears fits neatly into Martinez’s framework. The $2.70–$2.77 area is being tested as a foundation, while the zone above $2.80 is acting as the ceiling. Trading volume spiked whenever XRP tried to break higher, reflecting resistance from sellers who are not yet willing to let the price climb further.The price action underscores why Martinez’s levels matter: XRP is boxed in between the supports he identified and the resistance just overhead, leaving traders to watch whether buyers or sellers will seize control first.For now, XRP’s direction hinges on whether it can stay anchored above its lower support zone long enough to gather the strength needed for a push toward $3.70.

10. [Polygon Leads Crypto Gains With 16% Weekend Surge as CoinDesk 20 Index Holds Steady](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/01/polygon-leads-crypto-gains-with-16-surge-as-coindesk-20-index-holds-steady)

The native token of Polygon (POL), an Ethereum scaling network, led gains through the weekend in the broad-market crypto benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20).POL surged 16% from Friday through early Monday, topping $0.29 for the first time since early March, CoinDesk data shows. Recently, it pared back some of the advance slipping below $0.28.The move happened as the CD20 remained little changed with bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum's ether (ETH) posting only modest gains.While there wasn't any clear catalyst behind POL's surge, some positive developments may have bolstered the token's performance.Polygon was one of the chains mentioned last week in the U.S. government's initiative to release key economic data such as GDP on blockchain rails.The network also announced an integration last week with USDT0, a Tether-focused cross-chain stablecoin protocol, that could help boost the network's position as a key liquidity hub for stablecoin flows.On the technical front, POL's breakout signals strong bullish momentum, CoinDesk's Research model showed. Despite the consolidation from its recent peak, buying pressure in the $0.277-$0.278 range could signals continued support for further gains, the model said.Read more: U.S. Government Starts Pushing Economic Data Onto Blockchains as 'Proof of Concept'

11. [Sonic Community Approves $150M Token Issuance for U.S. ETF Push, Nasdaq Vehicle](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/01/sonic-community-approves-usd150m-token-issuance-for-u-s-etf-push-nasdaq-vehicle)

Community members of Sonic, the rebranded Fantom blockchain, approved a large bet on institutional adoption with a vote to fund a U.S. expansion strategy that includes the creation of a $50 million ETF initiative, a $100 million investment program and the creation of a Delaware-registered company.The vote found support from 99.99% of participants. The community rejected the alternative “no-change” option almost unanimously, with just 51,200 votes against the plan and 860.6 million in favor.Sonic Labs pitched the proposal as a necessary break from its “2018 tokenomics,” which involved Fantom Foundation giving away most of its supply to the community. That structure left the foundation holding just 3% of tokens at launch, compared with 50%–90% held by peers. While community-friendly, the team argued it hobbled its ability to fund listings on crypto exchanges, acquisitions and partnerships. The new issuance is designed to close that gap and make Sonic competitive in a market where blockchains increasingly act like companies.In addition to the ETF initiative, the vote authorizes private investment in a public equity (PIPE) vehicle on Nasdaq, and the seeding of 150 million S tokens for Sonic USA, which will be based in New York City. S were created as part of last year's rebranding.The ETF plan will involve a regulated provider with over $10 billion in assets under management, with custody handled by BitGo. The PIPE vehicle aims to seed a Nasdaq-listed entity’s balance sheet with S tokens locked for at least three years in exchange for strategic treasury purchases.At the network level, fees will also be redirected under a revised mechanism to burn more tokens and reduce inflation — a nod to token holder demands for deflationary pressure.Whether these moves translate into real adoption remains to be seen, but Sonic now has both the mandate and the war chest to compete directly in the ETF and traditional finance arena.

12. [Solv and Chainlink Bring Real-Time Collateral Verification to SolvBTC Pricing](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/01/solv-and-chainlink-bring-real-time-collateral-verification-to-solvbtc-pricing)

Solv Protocol, a financial services provider for bitcoin (BTC) holders, has partnered with decentralized oracle network Chainlink to integrate real-time verification of Solv's actual BTC reserves backing its liquid token, SolvBTC, directly into its price feed. This integration enhances transparency and builds greater trust for users.Unlike traditional price feeds that rely solely on market data, the new SolvBTC-BTC Secure Exchange Rate feed combines exchange rate calculations with real-time proof of reserves, delivering an on-chain redemption rate firmly anchored in verifiable collateral.Additionally, the mechanism features built-in upper and lower bounds based on reserve data, making it resistant to manipulation and safer for use in decentralized lending markets such as Aave.“We’re excited to work with Chainlink to launch a Secure Exchange Rate feed. This marks a major evolution in DeFi security, allowing protocols to more accurately price wrapped assets by leveraging redemption rates rooted in verifiable collateral, powered by the Chainlink standard,” said Ryan Chow, Co-Founder and CEO of Solv, in a press release shared with CoinDesk.The SolvBTC-BTC Secure Exchange Rate feed is now live on the Ethereum mainnet, with plans to expand to other chains, including BOB.SolvBTC, launched in April 2024, is a bitcoin-backed liquid staking token that enables BTC holders to participate in decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystems and earn yield while maintaining BTC exposure. Users can deposit BTC and mint SolvBTC, a liquid representation of staked BTC, usable across various DeFi protocols, including vaults, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and lending platforms.Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve (PoR) leverages its decentralized oracle network to verify that the on-chain supply of tokenized assets, like stablecoins or wrapped assets, is fully backed by actual reserves held off-chain or on other blockchains.With billions of dollars in wrapped assets circulating within DeFi, transparent, reliable pricing mechanisms are increasingly critical. By combining PoR with price feeds atop Chainlink's existing cross-chain interoperability via CCIP, Solv enables wrapped assets to function securely as collateral across multiple blockchains.Johann Eid, Chief Business Officer at Chainlink Labs, summarized it well: “By combining real-time collateral verification with exchange rate logic, this solution delivers a redemption rate rooted in cryptographic truth, raising the security standard for wrapped assets across DeFi.”

13. [Bitcoin Miner IREN's AI Push Gains Momentum, Price Target Hiked 60% to $37: Canaccord](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/29/bitcoin-miner-iren-s-ai-push-gains-momentum-price-target-hiked-60-to-usd37-canaccord)

IREN (IREN) reported fourth-quarter results that highlighted rapid progress in both its bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence infrastructure businesses, according to a Friday research report by broker Canaccord Genuity.The broker reiterated its buy rating on the stock and hiked its price target 60% to $37 from $24, citing stronger visibility in both mining and AI revenue streams.In early trading, shares are higher by 25% to $28.75.The company’s mining unit reached an annualized revenue run rate above $1 billion, powered by 50 exahash per second (EH/s) of capacity and one of the industry’s most efficient fleets at 15 J/TH, operating on 3.5 cent/kWh power, analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote. That translates into a $36,000 cost to mine a bitcoin, well below market levels.Bitcoin mining revenue came in at $187.3 million for the quarter, up 33% sequentially, while adjusted EBITDA jumped 46% to $121.9 million.On the AI side, IREN is accelerating expansion, the report noted. The bitcoin miner quadrupled its hashrate and added another megawatt of power capacity, now totaling 3 MW, with further growth expected in fiscal 2025.The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.Canaccord also noted IREN's recent designation as an NVIDIA (NVDA) preferred partner, which came almost simultaneously with the announcement of the purchase of an additional 2,400 GPUs.With 2,910 MW of secured power capacity and some of the lowest all-in cash costs in the industry, Canaccord argues IREN is positioned to become one of the largest and most efficient publicly listed miners, with significant optionality in high-performance computing.Read more: IREN Posts First Full-Year Profit on AI Cloud Growth, Mining Expansion; Shares Climb

14. [Bitcoin ‘Short Strangle’ Preferred as Market Signals Near-Term Calm: 10x Research](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/29/bitcoin-short-strangle-preferred-as-market-signals-near-term-calm-10x-research)

Bitcoin (BTC) defied expectations for significant volatility in August, trading within a range. As market dynamics indicate a continued low-volatility regime in the near term, 10x Research highlights the "short strangle" as an ideal play."Given the current dynamics in the bitcoin options market, a short strangle looks well-suited for the next month. With bitcoin trading around $113,000 and an expected range between $95,000 and $125,000, selling an out-of-the-money [September expiry] put near $95,000 alongside an out-of-the-money [September expiry] call near $125,000 provides an opportunity to capture premium," Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a report to clients Thursday.Short strangle involves a simultaneous writing (selling) of out-of-the-money higher strike calls and OTM lower strike puts with the same expiry, positioned equidistant from the underlying asset's spot price.The strategy is similar to selling insurance against both bullish and bearish moves in exchange for a premium, which represents the maximum profit achievable if the spot price remains between the two strike prices - $95,000 and $125,000 in this case.Selling options (or strangles) is a common strategy when implied volatility (IV) exceeds realized volatility, as this allows traders to capture richer premiums, and the market is expected to remain relatively stable."The strategy works because the implied volatility curve is trading above realized levels, signaling options are overpriced, and the market is unlikely to deliver large moves outside your defined range in the short run," Thielen noted. "The options implied volatility term structure indicates near-term calm."The implied volatility (IV) term structure is a graphical representation showing how volatility is expected to evolve across different future time horizons. It is typically upward sloping, reflecting increasing uncertainty and risk as the time to expiration lengthens.Risk-reward profileBTC needs to continue trading between $95,000 and $125,000 for the suggested strategy to generate profits. The rangebound trading will reduce the demand for OTM calls and puts, thereby draining premium from these options and generating a profit for strangle sellers.Thielen’s previous recommendation from early August was also a short strangle, involving a $105,000 put and a $130,000 call. This strategy generated a yield of 3.5%.Note, however, that short strangles carry significant risks, particularly in the event of a sudden spike in volatility, which can lead to substantial losses. Therefore, traders must continuously monitor the position and relevant market variables to manage risk effectively.Read more: Bitcoin Headed to $190K on Institutional Wave, Research Firm Says

Polkadot's DOT earlier Thurwday rose more than 2%, with institutional volume patterns suggesting professional participation, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.The model showed the digital asset demonstrating textbook institutional accumulation behavior, initially testing support at $3.81 before executing a measured advance to $4.02 accompanied by substantial volume of 4.6 million units.Trading volumes exceeding 320,000 units during the initial decline phase indicate institutional repositioning rather than retail panic, with subsequent buying interest establishing clear support levels around $3.90-$3.91, according to the model.The move higher in Polkadot reversed though, with the price slipping back to that $3.90 support.On the news front, the Republic of Paraguay has committed $6 million to a Polkadot-based tokenization initiative, according to a post on X , a landmark government endorsement of blockchain technology for sovereign infrastructure development.Technical Analysis:DOT established a trading range of $0.21 representing 5.2% volatility between $3.81 floor and $4.02 ceiling during 24-hour sessionProfessional support formation confirmed at $3.90-$3.91 levels with institutional buying interestResistance threshold identified at $4.02 with volume-driven price discovery mechanismsInstitutional volume patterns exceeding 320,000 units indicate sophisticated market participationRecovery trajectory from $3.81 to $4.02 supported by 4.6 million trading units demonstrating market depthConsolidation range between $3.91-$3.95 suggests institutional accumulation during market weakness.Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

16. [Solana Targets Near-Instant Finality as Alpenglow Upgrade Heads to Vote](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/08/28/solana-targets-near-instant-finality-as-alpenglow-upgrade-heads-to-vote)

Solana developers are pushing a major consensus overhaul with the Alpenglow proposal, now in the validator voting stage.Just over 10% of validators have backed the upgrade as of European morning hours on Thursday, a tracker shows, with over 88% of eligible participants yet to cast their choice.If passed, it would replace Proof-of-History and TowerBFT with a faster, more resilient design centered on two new components: Votor and Rotor.Proof of history is Solana’s existing consensus mechanism. It timestamps transactions, allowing validators to determine the correct order without wasting time on syncing (which creates a slower network). TowerBFT is the network’s voting system. Validators use previous votes as a guide, helping them quickly agree on the next block while resisting attacks.The big draw in the new consensus proposal Votor, which would cut the time it takes for a transaction to be finalized from more than 12 seconds to around 150 milliseconds, making network confirmations feel effectively instant for users.Rotor, planned for a later stage, aims to make the network more efficient by reducing the number of times data needs to be transferred between validators — an upgrade designed to support high-activity applications, such as DeFi and gaming.Alpenglow also introduces a “20+20” resilience model, which promises to keep the chain running even if 20% of validators are adversarial and another 20% are offline.The proposal frames this as a step toward achieving faster speeds while enhancing security and fairness for validators.

17. [As Bitcoin Bounces, On-Chain Data Point to Selling Pressure Near $113.6K](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/28/as-bitcoin-bounces-on-chain-data-point-to-sell-pressure-near-usd113-6k)

As bitcoin (BTC) bulls aim to reestablish an upward price trajectory, they may face resistance from sellers near the $113,600 level, according to on-chain data.BTC has already bounced to $112,800 from sub-$108,800 levels hit Tuesday, CoinDesk data show. The bounce is likely fueled by a fresh all-time high in the S&P 500 and a better-than-expected earnings report by Nvidia, one of the largest publicly listed companies in the world by market value and a bellwether for all things artificial intelligence.The path ahead may prove challenging, as investors holding at a loss may look to sell into any price rebound."Currently, bitcoin trades beneath the cost basis of both the 1-month ($115.6k) and 3-month ($113.6k) cohorts, leaving these investors under stress. Any relief rally is therefore likely to encounter resistance, as short-term holders seek to exit at breakeven," analytics firm Glassnode said in a report published Wednesday.Glassnode's cost basis metric reveals the average purchase prices at which digital assets have been acquired by wallets with varying holding durations. For example, the three-month cost basis of $113,600 indicates that investors holding assets purchased within the past three months paid, on average, this price level.Mixed flowsAs of now, the spot market flows suggest an uphill battle for the bulls ahead, while ETF and corporate activity suggest otherwise."Spot demand remains neutral, as perpetuals tilt bearish with CVD negative. The current funding rate of ~0.01% points to a fragile neutrality. If price breaks above $112.4K with volume, it opens the pathway to $114K – $116K," Timothy Misir, head of research, BRN.That said, ETF inflows and corporate adoption of BTC continues to suck out significant supply from the market, offering a bullish hope, Misir explained. "ETF flows continue to strengthen with $81 million for Bitcoin ETFs and $307 million for Ether ETFs over the past day. ETFs, corporates, and governments are now absorbing ~3,600 BTC/day, which translates to ~4x miner issuance. Metaplanet announced a new plan to raise $881 million to buy $837 million BTC in Sep–Oct, adding to its 18,991 BTC," he noted. Gauging key supportShould BTC turn lower, then $107,000 is the key support level to watch.That's because analysis by Glassnode shows that the six-month cost basis is at that level. So, a break lower would prompt these holdings to sell, potentially causing a more profound decline."The 6-month cost basis sits near ~$107k. A sustained move below this level risks triggering fear, which could accelerate downside momentum," Glassnode said.

Filecoin (FIL) rebounded 6% from its 24 hour lows in a strong bullish reversal, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.The model showed that FIL demonstrated resilience with a steady climb from the $2.15 low to close at $2.31, delivering a 6.4% rebound that signals underlying accumulation and potential trend reversal momentum.FIL trading volume was 75% above 30-day averages, signaling heightened institutional interest.The storage token established strong support levels during the rebound, according to the model.The bounce in Filecoin came as the wider crypto market fell, with the broader market gauge, the Coindesk 20, down 2.1%.In recent trading, FIL was 0.9% higher over 24 hours, trading around $2.31.Technical Analysis:Price range spans $0.15 (6.8%) between $2.31 peak and $2.15 trough during 24-hour session.Sharp decline from $2.26 to $2.15 on Aug. 25 between 7-8 p.m. UTC, with heavy volume of 15.1 million establishes support.The recovery pattern shows a 6.4% bounce from $2.15 low to $2.28 close, indicating underlying accumulation.Breakout above $2.27 resistance at 11:50 a.m. UTC on Aug. 26 triggers sustained buying pressure.Final 20-minute rally from $2.27 to $2.89 with elevated volume exceeding 150,000 tokens confirms institutional flows.Classic accumulation behavior with consolidation around $2.27 support zone through 11:47 a.m. UTC.Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

19. [Large Liquidations Mask Whale's Buy-the-Bitcoin-Dip Strategy: Crypto Daybook Americas](https://www.coindesk.com/daybook-us/2025/08/26/large-liquidations-mask-whale-s-buy-the-bitcoin-dip-strategy-crypto-daybook-americas)

By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)The sell-off in the cryptocurrency market deepened over the past 24 hours, with bitcoin (BTC) falling below $109,000 for the first time since July 9 and ether (ETH) posting a 13% correction from the record high of around $4,950 it hit just two days ago.The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) and CoinDesk 80 (CD80) indices have dropped 2% and 3.3%, respectively, indicating larger losses in the broader altcoin market.The downside volatility toasted leveraged futures bets worth over $900 million, with long positions accounting for the majority of the tally. The slide kicked off on Sunday, when a whale sold 25,000 BTC in an illiquid market, sparking a flash crash. Several theories have been proposed to explain the whale's strategy, the most prominent being that they intentionally removed the bid wall — or block of buy orders — assuming that institutions would buy more through ETFs during the week, thereby lifting prices."This whale is showing us something bigger, they know the ETF/sovereign bid is infinite. So the only way to win is to force weak hands to puke and then accumulate back into the structural wall," pseudonymous observer SightBringer said on X.According to MEXC Ventures, BTC is now at an inflexion point. It could enter a period of consolidation between $110,000 and $120,000 or break lower toward $105,000 to $100,000. "The absence of a fresh macro catalyst, such as a dovish Fed policy pivot, rate cuts, or renewed inflows, is likely to drive BTC into a period of market consolidation as the market digests the recent distribution," MEXC's Investment Director Leo Zhao said in an email.Similarly, the consensus remains bullish on ether. However, the sharp decline from Sunday's record suggests a sustained breakout to new highs will probably require a significant catalyst beyond just corporate treasury adoption.XRP, meanwhile, lacks a clear directional trend. "With Bollinger Bands constricting and RSI sitting at a neutral 44, but thin on buying volume, the chart is whispering of a potential retest of $2.60 to $2.00," Ryan Lee, the chief analyst at Bitget said. "A break above the $3.10 level with conviction and volume, and a run toward $3.40 could follow. But derivative markets are skewed short, and upside stays guarded until momentum firms."In traditional markets, the Treasury yield curve, represented by the spread between 10- and two-year yields and 30- and two-year yields, continues to steepen as traders bet on a September Fed rate cut. Meanwhile, longer-duration Japanese government bond yields are on the verge of hitting new multidecade highs, which could potentially inject volatility into global financial markets.

Pudgy Penguins saw 2,112 ETH ($9.36 million) in weekly volume, followed by Moonbirds (1,979 ETH), CryptoPunks (1,879 ETH), and BAYC (809 ETH).Overall NFT market capitalization shrank nearly 5% to $7.7 billion, down from a $9.3 billion peak on Aug. 13. The $1.6 billion drawdown highlights how quickly capital flees when ETH slumps.The sharp contrast between resilient CryptoPunks and sliding newer collections strengthens its appeal as a collateral asset. Its liquidity holds up even as broader NFT floors collapse.For investors, the sell-off signals that NFT blue chips remain high-beta ETH proxies, with only legacy projects like CryptoPunks showing the defensive value that makes them the safer long-term institutional bet.Derivatives PositioningLeveraged crypto bulls have been burned, with futures bets worth $940 million liquidated in the past 24 hours. More than $800 million were long positions betting on price gains. Ether alone accounted for $320 million in liquidations.Still, overall open interest (OI) in BTC remains elevated near lifetime highs above 740K BTC. In ether's case, the OI has pulled back to 14 million ETH from 14.60 million ETH.OI in SOL, XRP, DOGE, ADA, and LINK also dropped in the past 24 hours, indicating net capital outflows.Despite the price volatility, funding rates for most major tokens, excluding SHIB, ADA and SOL, remains positive to suggest dominance of bullish long positions.OI in the CME-listed standard BTC futures has fallen back to 137.3K from 145.2K, reversing the minor bounce from early this month. It shows that institutional interest in trading these regulated derivatives remains low. OI in options, however, has continued to increase, reaching its highest since late May,CME's ether futures OI remains elevated at 2.05 million ETH, just shy of the record 2.15 million ETH on Aug. 22. Meanwhile, OI in ether options is now at its highest since September last year.On Deribit, the impending multibillion-dollar expiry on Friday shows a bias towards BTC puts, indicative of concerns prices are set to drop further.
